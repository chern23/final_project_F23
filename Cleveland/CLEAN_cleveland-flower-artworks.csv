Flower Study of a Lily of the Valley,19th - 20th Century,Russia,Miscellaneous,"This flower study resembles a stem of lily-of-the-valley. Fabergé’s inspiration for his flower studies is said to have come from the floral brooches of precious stones that were made in the 1700s for Catherine the Great as well as from the Japanese art of flower arranging, known as ikebana. Small and delicate, Fabergé’s flower studies were given as intimate gifts to friends by the tsarina and others in the court. She also liked to take them around to wherever the imperial family was residing as a reminder of spring during the harsh Russian winters."
White Flower,20th Century,United States,Painting,"O’Keeffe is best known for close-up flower subjects whose magnified forms fill the entire space of each canvas. Likely inspired by similar compositions in modern photography, these images are not only celebrations of natural forms, but also striking essays in abstract design. Although many critics interpreted O’Keeffe’s flower paintings as reflections of femininity in general and female sexuality in particular, the artist strongly opposed such readings. Throughout most of her career, she frequently attempted to persuade others to discuss her work without referring to her gender, writing on one occasion, “I have always been very annoyed at being referred to as a ‘woman artist’ rather than an ‘artist.’”"
Flower Study of an Anemone,20th Century,Russia,Miscellaneous,"This flower study depicts a wild anemone in bloom. Fabergé’s inspiration for his flower studies is said to have come from the floral brooches of precious stones that were made in the 1700s for Catherine the Great as well as from the Japanese art of flower arranging, known as ikebana.

She also liked to take them around to wherever the imperial family was residing as a reminder of spring during the harsh Russian winters."
Flower Study of a Violet,19th - 20th Century,Russia,Miscellaneous,"This flower study depicts a single stem of violet. Fabergé’s inspiration for his flower studies is said to have come from the floral brooches of precious stones that were made in the 1700s for Catherine the Great as well as from the Japanese art of flower arranging, known as ikebana. Small and delicate, Fabergé’s flower studies were given as intimate gifts to friends by the tsarina and others in the court. She also liked to take them around to wherever the imperial family was residing as a reminder of spring during the harsh Russian winters."
Flower Study of a Pansy,19th - 20th Century,Russia,Miscellaneous,"This flower study depicts a pansy in bloom.

She also liked to take them around to wherever the imperial family was residing as a reminder of spring during the harsh Russian winters."
Flower Study of Forget-Me-Nots,19th - 20th Century,Russia,Miscellaneous,"These delicate flowers, resembling a bouquet of forget-me-nots, are composed of finely rounded turquoise stones set around rose-cut diamonds on silver-gilt stems placed in rock crystal pots. Fabergé’s inspiration for his flower studies is said to have come from the floral brooches of precious stones that were made in the 1700s for Catherine the Great as well as from the Japanese art of flower arranging, known as ikebana. Fabergé’s flower studies were given as intimate gifts to friends by the tsarina and others in the court. She also liked to take them around to wherever the imperial family was residing as a reminder of spring during the harsh Russian winters."
Flower Study of a Lowbush Cranberry or Lingonberry,19th - 20th Century,Russia,Miscellaneous,"This flower study depicts a lowbush cranberry or lingonberry. To achieve a naturalistic effect of ripening fruit, Fabergé varied the coloring of the berries. Some are made of chalcedony in hues of milky white to represent unripe berries, while others appear in deep reddish agate to represent ripe ones. Fabergé’s inspiration for his flower studies is said to have come from the floral brooches of precious stones that were made in the 1700s for Catherine the Great as well as from the Japanese art of flower arranging, known as ikebana. Fabergé’s flower studies were given as intimate gifts to friends by the tsarina and others in the court. She also liked to take them around to wherever the imperial family was residing as a reminder of spring during the harsh Russian winters."
Flower Study of a Miniature Lily of the Valley,19th - 20th Century,Russia,Miscellaneous,"A small, carved rock crystal vase holds this lily of the valley study. The pearls, forming the flower’s buds, are drilled and attached to the remarkably slim gold stem. The hand-cut nephrite (jade) leaves enhance the naturalistic aura of the flower. Fabergé’s inspiration for his flower studies is said to have come from the floral brooches of precious stones that were made in the 1700s for Catherine the Great as well as from the Japanese art of flower arranging, known as ikebana."
Royal Woman Holding a Flower,17th Century,Null,Painting,"Following the model of formal imperial Mughal court portraiture, the artist has lavished care on shading the face of a royal woman and the distinctive qualities of her luxurious textiles. Details have been exquisitely rendered, including the fringe of her pink shawl with its lotus vine border and the sprigs of flowers tucked in her hair."
"The Marsh Flower, a Sad Human Head",19th Century,France,Print,"This series is one of many that Odilon Redon created throughout his career. Nearly two-thirds of his lithographs took the form of portfolios—prints connected conceptually by a theme or narrative and physically by a folder or binding. Such works were often dispersed over time, but Cleveland was fortunate to acquire several complete sets with their original covers during the 1920s. Dating from Redon’s early experimentation with lithography, Homage to Goya was intended as a tribute to 18th-century Spanish master Francisco de Goya, whose interest in dreams and the subconscious influenced Redon. The six seemingly unrelated images celebrate Goya’s ambiguity and collectively suggest the introspection and isolation of artistic practice."
Vase with flower arrangement and scrollwork,18th Century,Null,Painting,"The symmetry of the floral arrangement emerging from the blue-and-white porcelain vase reveals an idealized vision. The overflowing vase is among the most ancient motifs in Indian art, used to convey the concept of abundance. This image, made for an elite patron of northern India, implies the prosperity that has accrued from international connections. The vase, painted with a European-style landscape, is of the type that was made in China for export to Europe. The scrolling ornament on either side may be ultimately derived from Persian motifs, but reworked into a European style, painted by Indian artists."
Flowers in a Glass,17th Century,Netherlands,Painting,"One of the first artists to specialize in flower painting, Ambrosius Bosschaert may have been inspired by the botanical gardens and scientific collections in his hometown of Middelburg. The flowers in this bouquet might be common today, but in the 1600s they were costly rarities. Bosschaert captured their fragile beauty with luminous colors and exquisite detail."
Flower Stand (Jardinière),19th Century,France,Furniture,"Thomire was the most productive and famous bronze caster in Paris around 1800. The border of this flower stand was cast from the same molds used for a centerpiece signed by Thomire; therefore, the stand can safely be presumed to have been produced by Thomire as well."
Vase of Flowers,20th Century,France,Drawing,"Inspired by Cleveland’s groundbreaking acquisitions of Odilon Redon’s artworks during the 1920s, local philanthropist and collector Leonard C. Hanna Jr. purchased this luminous pastel of a floral still life in 1937. Hanna acquired it from Jacques Seligmann, a dealer based in New York City and Paris who was fundamental in bringing 19th-century French art to American audiences. In 1939, Hanna loaned the pastel to the New York World’s Fair, where it represented Redon’s work. Those who saw it there were attracted to the vivid color and timeless subject, which preoccupied the artist at the end of his life."
Flower-shaped Mirror,12th Century,Null,Metalwork,"From ancient times, a mirror assumed various roles; a ritualistic tool, a diplomatic gift, and a luxury commodity. During the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392), which saw the great advancement of metallurgy, the royal court was the center of distributing sophisticated bronze artifacts. According to historical records, on the 7th day of the Lunar New Year, the king bestowed a bronze mirror inscribed with auspicious symbols upon each court official as part of a ceremony to celebrate the Day of Humans. This explains why a large quantity of bronze mirrors were excavated from elite tombs."
Flower Market,20th Century,Mexico,Print,"Following the Mexican Revolution, artists throughout the country began to create works that celebrated the country's history and future. In this print, Diego Rivera shows a gathering of figures in indigenous costume gathering to exchange flowers, suggesting Mexico's bounty. Such images formed an important statement about national identity at a time of constant change."
Flower Vase with Chrysanthemums,20th Century,Japan,Ceramics,"Seifū Yohei III (1851–1914) was a son of the Maruyama school painter Okada Ryōhei (dates unknown). Though he studied painting, he ultimately succeeded his ceramics mentor, Seifū Yohei II (1845–1878), in Kyoto. He distinguished himself as a remarkable porcelain artist, taking Qing dynasty Chinese wares as his inspiration. He experimented widely with new glazing techniques. In 1893, he became the first ceramicist to be appointed as an Imperial Household Artist under a system introduced by the Japanese government in 1890. He produced many works for use in Chinese-style tea gatherings called sencha."
Plate with Bird and Flower,20th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This dish is a sophisticated example of later ceramists reinterpreting earlier styles of Japanese porcelain. The colors and patterns used look similar to some works produced on the island of Kyushu in the1600s and 1700s. However, the idea to combine alternating blocks of yellow, green, purple, and blue with a ""Chinese grasses"" (karakusa) pattern around the rim of the dish is one hit upon in the early 1900s by an artist familiar with the colors and patterns of earlier works."
Covent Garden Flower Women,19th Century,England,Photograph,"Thomson’s collaborator, reporter Adolphe Smith said that “The familiar sight of a poor woman holding a pale child in her arms and offering modest violets to the pedestrian, is pregnant with a poetry which rags, and dirt fail to obliterate.” The jobs, which were passed down between generations, required worked long hours and yielded a meager income."
Flower Shade,20th Century,Japan,Calligraphy,"The calligraphy of poems still inspires many contemporary artists. Here, Ninomiya Hakuryu expressed his sensitive playfulness by writing the title of this work, Flower Shade, on a fan turned at a 90-degree angle and a haiku on the fan-shaped paper below."
Vase of Flowers,20th Century,France,Painting,"Known for his dark, velvety charcoal drawings and lithographs, Redon began working predominantly in oil and pastel after 1900, thus enlisting color in his explorations of the world of dreams and the imagination. Like other Symbolists, Redon searched for alternative experiences beyond the rational logic of Naturalism and Impressionism. He used his knowledge of botany as a starting point for this painting, but infused the flowers with heightened luminosity and sensuous form."
Flower Vase,16th Century,France,Ceramics,"Made as two separate elements, this extremely rare example of Saint-Porchaire ware may have been conceived primarily as a tour de force of decorative art."
Still Life: Bouquet of Flowers Emerging from the Grass,18th Century,Null,Painting,"Studies of flower arrangements in the European manner became a popular subject in Indian miniature painting during the reign of Mughal emperor Jahangir (reigned 1605–27). Inspired by imported prints, Indian artists rendered them in Mughal fashion. Here, in a painting made at a Rajasthani court, the entire bouquet grows magically out of the ground from a single stem."
A Young Woman Buying a Pink from a Young Man,18th Century,Italy,Drawing,"Giovanni Battista Piazzetta was celebrated for his finished drawings of saints, portraits, and teste di carattere (character heads). Cleveland’s sheet belongs to the latter genre, which describes portraits embellished with props to suggest a character type or types. Here, Piazzetta united three independent studies of individuals into a single scene, in which a young woman appears to purchase a pink—a type of flower related to the carnation—from a boy with a second young woman looking on.The image bristles with tantalizing narrative potential, but it is left to the viewer to interpret the scene as they wish. Drawings of this size and quality of finish were displayed on walls like paintings, rather than stored in portfolios, with the unfortunate consequence that the Venetian blue paper often faded to a grayish-tan as here. However, the virtuosity of Piazzetta’s technique endures on this sheet. His method of modeling—wetting and rubbing his black crayon rather than hatching—produces the density of tone and velvety shadow. Textural details are supplied by white chalk, evoking the silky weave of the boy’s shirt and the hard substance of the figures’ fingernails. Piazzetta's drawings were in high demand among affluent foreign visitors and helped to supplement his income."
Flower Vase with Phoenix in Paulownia,19th - 20th Century,Japan,Ceramics,"One of Seifū Yohei III’s most visually impactful techniques, seen in this work, was to combine complex low-relief designs in clay surrounded by diffused underglaze blue or pink, which he then covered with a transparent or translucent glaze. Yohei III also experimented with clay bodies ranging from bluish white to ivory combined with translucent cream-colored glazes. The atmospheric effects he achieved were considered remarkable."
Spring Flowers,19th Century,France,Painting,"This early work reveal's Monet's fascination with capturing the transitory effects that became the primary focus of his later innovations. Painted with almost scientific accuracy, this still life has a freshness and immediacy derived partly from its composition. Isolated against a dark background, the fully mature peonies, potted hydrangeas, and basketed lilacs spill downward and outward from the geraniums at the rear. At the same time, Monet's energetic brushwork conveys the sparkling play of light on leaves and petals."
Flower-shaped Mirror,12th - 13th Century,Null,Metalwork,"From ancient times, a mirror assumed various roles; a ritualistic tool, a diplomatic gift, and a luxury commodity. During the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392), which saw the great advancement of metallurgy, the royal court was the center of distributing sophisticated bronze artifacts. According to historical records, on the 7th day of the Lunar New Year, the king bestowed a bronze mirror inscribed with auspicious symbols upon each court official as part of a ceremony to celebrate the Day of Humans. This explains why a large quantity of bronze mirrors were excavated from elite tombs."
Morning Glory with Black,20th Century,United States,Painting,"O'Keeffe is best known for close-up flower subjects whose magnified forms fill the entire space of each canvas. Likely inspired by similar compositions in modern photography, these images are not only celebrations of nature, but also striking essays in abstract design. Although many critics interpreted O'Keeffe's flower paintings as reflections of femininity in general and female sexuality in particular, the artist strongly opposed such readings. Throughout most of her career, she frequently attempted to persuade others to discuss her work without referring to her gender, writing on one occasion, ""I have always been very annoyed at being referred to as a 'woman artist' rather than an 'artist.'"""
Stater: Three-Petal Flower (obverse); Horse and wheels (reverse),1st Century BCE - 1st Century CE,Null,Coins,"The Iceni were a native tribe inhabiting Norfolk, Suffolk, and parts of Cambridgeshire. They were described by the Romans as powerful, unbroken by war. In AD 61 the king of the Iceni, Prasutagus, died, leaving his apparently considerable wealth to his two daughters and to the Roman Emperor, as joint heirs. However, while the Roman legions under Aulus Plautius were in Wales taking drastic steps to exterminate Druidism, Boadicea, the widow of Prasutagus, was ill-treated by the Romans and her two daughters were outraged. The Iceni rose in revolt and helped by their neighbors the Trinovantes, they overran the Roman settlements. It is said that 70,000 Romans were massacred at Camulodunum, and the Iceni, with Boadicea in a war chariot at their head, sacked and burned Verulamium (St. Albans, Hertfordshire), and London. Suetonius, one of the leading Roman generals, returned from the west with all possible speed and came up with the Iceni in the northwest of Roman London. Here a great battle was fought, resulting in a complete victory for the disciplined Roman forces; thousands of Britons were killed. The site of this battle is supposed to have been near what is now Kings Cross, in central London, commemorated by Battle Bridge Road."
Vase with Bird and Flower Design,19th - 20th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This vase with broad shoulders and a tall neck represents a typical style of 19th-century blue-and-white porcelain. Unlike earlier examples decorated mainly with literati themes that evoke neo-Confucian moral values—plum blossoms (purity), orchids (grace), bamboo (integrity), and chrysanthemums (loftiness)—porcelain works of the 1800s feature fully bloomed peonies and a pair of playful birds, symbols of wealth and familial harmony."
Pair of Hexagonal Flower Pots,14th - 15th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This deep hexagonal flowerpot, one of a pair in the collection, is numbered ""8"" and bears additional inscriptions to indicate specifically the location of its usage within the palace: ""for use in the Study of Illumination (Mingchuang yong)"" within the ""Hall of Cultivating the Mind (Yangxin Dian)"" of the Forbidden City. The inscriptions seem to suggest the Qing imperial provenance of this pair."
Sandy and Her Husband,20th Century,United States,Painting,"In Sandy and Her Husband, the dancing couple at the center of the image is joined by Amos herself: the artist inserted herself into the picture by rendering an earlier self-portrait, Flower Sniffer (1966), which hangs on the wall behind the couple. However, even as Amos is part of the composition, she is peripheral to the scene, unseen or ignored by the dancers. From the early 1960s until her death in 2020, Amos made paintings, prints, and textiles celebrating African American identity and culture, and often exploring women’s presence within that heritage."
Eight-foiled Mirror with Flower and Phoenix Design,12th Century,Null,Metalwork,"From ancient times, a mirror assumed various roles; a ritualistic tool, a diplomatic gift, and a luxury commodity. During the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392), which saw the great advancement of metallurgy, the royal court was the center of distributing sophisticated bronze artifacts. According to historical records, on the 7th day of the Lunar New Year, the king bestowed a bronze mirror inscribed with auspicious symbols upon each court official as part of a ceremony to celebrate the Day of Humans. This explains why a large quantity of bronze mirrors were excavated from elite tombs."
Ink Flowers,14th Century,China,Painting,"Zhao Zhong's flowers, each paired with a poem, echo the fine-style colored flowers of the academic tradition, but instead he used only ink. Fine lines define the contours of each plant, as well as the veins within each petal and leaf. Careful ink washes give subtle modeling to the forms. The combination of lily, narcissus, and peony is unusual as the three belong to no known seasonal or symbolic system popular in the fourteenth century. Zhao’s medical training may have influenced the selection. Powdered lilies, for example, were prescribed to dispel grief, while the bark of tree peony roots was used as a treatment for various blood disorders."
Bowl with Flower Petals,14th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Yuan dynasty Shufu ware was a further development of the earlier qingbai ware and is characterized by a more heavily constructed body, opaque white glaze, molded decoration, and at times the inscription Shufu that gives the ware its name. Although lacking the inscription here, this bowl possesses the characteristics and decoration of Shufu pieces."
Flower Vase with Butterflies,19th - 20th Century,Japan,Ceramics,"Kyoto-based Japanese ceramist Seifū Yohei III (1851–1914) admired the glaze colors found on Chinese porcelain and tried to replicate them through intensive experimentation. His green and creamy white glazes were particularly well received. The combinations of colors with subtle molded and incised decorations in his ceramics respond powerfully to changes in light, creating a dynamic viewing experience. Names for the glazes, written in ink with a brush on the lids of the custom-made storage boxes for the works, often indicate a specific glaze or ware that had inspired him, even when the resulting color was distinctively his own."
Mirror with Six Circular Flowers,7th Century,Null,Metalwork,"Around the mirror’s central knob, there are six floral designs set within circles, separated by candelabra-like dividers. These flower designs later became known as ""baoxiang hua 寶相花"" or ""flowers of precious appearance"", which often remind people of Buddhist connections. The design also includes a ribbon of inscription, praising the mirror’s clarity and celebrating the end of a war."
Flower Vase with Dragon Roundels,20th Century,Japan,Ceramics,"Kyoto-based Japanese ceramist Seifū Yohei III (1851–1914) admired the glaze colors found on Chinese porcelain and tried to replicate them through intensive experimentation. His green and creamy white glazes were particularly well received.

Names for the glazes, written in ink with a brush on the lids of the custom-made storage boxes for the works, often indicate a specific glaze or ware that had inspired him, even when the resulting color was distinctively his own."
Jar with Bird and Flower Decoration,18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Joseon blue-and-white porcelains were called “靑畫,"" meaning “painted in blue.” The blue here indicates cobalt pigment. In the 1700s, the royal court banned the importation of cobalt blue for its luxurious nature; thus, relatively few Joseon blue-and-white porcelain vessels were produced at that time. In that context, this modest-looking jar was considered to be a rare luxury."
Flower Container,18th Century,France,Ceramics,
Mirror with Lotus and Mantra,13th - 14th Century,Null,Metalwork,"This mirror features intricate Buddhist designs. Around the central knob are four leaves, a ring of tiny beads, and then a circle made up of small lotus flower designs. Outside of that are eight big petal shapes, inside each is a Sanskrit letter. The mirror has the phrase ""In the name of Om mani padme hum"" written in a slightly incorrect form of Sanskrit, possibly because the Chinese mirror maker was not familiar with the language."
Flower Garden,20th Century,Japan,Print,"Watanabe is associated with the Japanese folk art movement
that admired traditional crafts, like stencil, for their
unpretentiousness. Here, Watanabe employed wrinkled
handmade paper, commonly used for book covers and
endpapers, to add texture to the broad areas of flat color and
to emphasize the rough, handcrafted quality of his prints.
The unsophisticated, folk-like images allude to early Japanese
Buddhist prints, in which black lines, rich color contrasts,
and simple naïve forms are paramount. Being a Christian,
Watanabe often chose religious themes from the Bible."
Winter and Summer Flowers,17th Century,Japan,Painting,"White camellias bloom behind a large pine in the right screen and blue morning glories creep through bamboo in the left screen of this composition. The mountains and bridge suggest a continuous landscape, but the paintings actually juxtapose flowers of winter and summer, with time progressing from right to left. Kaihō Yūshō painted similar landscapes for Zen temples in Kyoto."
Plate with Bird and Flower,17th Century,Null,Ceramics,
"Fish and Flower and Female Buddha (Sakana, Hana to Butsujo)",20th Century,Japan,Print,"Munakata did not make detailed designs for his prints, preferring instead to develop the composition on the block itself, aided by a rough sketch (see drawing for Fish and Flower and Female Buddha [1959.9]). He identified with the woodblock itself and said, ""If there is anything here [in my print] that is inferior to an uncarved block, then I have not created my print. I have lost to the board."" Fish and Flower and Female Buddha was commissioned by the Print Club of Cleveland as its 1959 presentation print."
Sword Guard (Tsuba) with Fence and Flower,17th - 19th Century,Null,Arms and Armor,"An inscription on one side of this sword guard states that the maker went by the first name of Masafusa, and worked in the historical province of Musashi. This area includes modern Tokyo."
The Blue Passion-flower,18th Century,England,Print,"In the 18th century, new engraving and etching techniques offered a variety of tonal effects that enhanced botanical prints. While mezzotint (in which the plate is roughened and then the engraver works from dark to light creating different values) and stipple (dots create values) make it possible to create the rich tonal scale and velvety texture of oil paint, aquatint imitates the delicacy and transparency of watercolor and ink wash."
Plate from Dessert Service: Nettle Leaved Bell Flower,19th Century,England,Ceramics,"Each dish is decorated with recognizable plants, the names of which are inscribed on the base in both Latin and English. Identifying the blossoms only became customary in the late 18th century when a single piece of porcelain was decorated with one species, and flowers were represented along with leaves, stems, seed pods, and roots. All of this reflects Carolus Linnaeus’s recent invention of a scientific method to categorize all known flora. The decorations on the Derby factory’s products derive from contemporary English botanical publications. For instance, illustrations in William Curtis’s The Botanical Magazine served as models for the French marigold and nettle-leaved bell flower on the dessert service."
Flower Vase with Bamboo Joints,20th Century,Japan,Ceramics,"Seifū Yohei III (1851–1914) was a son of the Maruyama school painter Okada Ryōhei (dates unknown). Though he studied painting, he ultimately succeeded his ceramics mentor, Seifū Yohei II (1845–1878), in Kyoto.

He produced many works for use in Chinese-style tea gatherings called sencha."
Self Portrait,19th Century,France,Painting,"François LePage belonged to a family of flower painters and worked in the French city of Lyon, which was famous for producing silk, particularly fabric with flower motifs. Flower painting was a specialty associated with the Lyon school of painting, and is a subject that requires both delicacy and dexterity, both of which are highlighted in this small self-portrait."
"Flower, Birds, and Profile Animal Mola Panel",20th Century,Null,Garment,"This whimsical, well-made panel was created by a female artist of the Guna, an Indigenous people of the Republic of Panamá. It was one of two identical or similar panels that were stitched into the front or back of a blouse (mola). Such blouses are so distinctive to the Guna that they are the single most recognizable element of Guna cultural identity."
Canopy with Dragon among Flowers,12th - 15th Century,Null,Textile,"The tapestry sewn into the center of this canopy depicts dragons among flowers, a classic design in Chinese art. Its weavers paid attention to fine details, such as the color gradation of the dragon’s scales, or subtle color changes in the flower petals and leaves. The selection of colored silk threads is soft in tone but rich in variety. All these stylistic characteristics indicate that this tapestry was woven in an imperial Southern Song workshop in the capital of Hangzhou, a center of textile production in the Jiangnan region."
Birds and Flowers,16th Century,Japan,Painting,"The landscape depicted in this pair of screens follows a seasonal progression from right to left, starting with the blossoming plum of early spring and ending with late autumn peonies. A variety of smaller birds are positioned throughout the scene, and a trio of swimming ducks is bracketed by early summer irises and early autumn bellflowers at the center. While some raptors (birds of prey) terrorize a pheasant and an egret (a waterfowl) to the right, a peacock and peahen converse to the left. Hawks are associated with military prowess, while the peafowl suggest cultural prestige."
Hollyhock-shaped Cup,15th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This very rare porcelain cup is called a hollyhock cup because its rim resembles a hollyhock blossom. This type of cup was produced only in the state-owned kiln for a limited time from the late 1400s to mid-1500s. Like sunflowers, hollyhocks also open their blooms toward the sun, signifying loyalty to the king. According to Korean royal archives, hollyhock cups were used during state banquets when the king offered wine to court officials. Also, a hollyhock-shaped cup was used in tea ceremonies to welcome visiting Chinese diplomats. In comparison to ceramic works of the late Joseon period that favor natural and rustic sensibilities seen in this gallery, this hollyhock cup illustrates the precision and perfection that were core aesthetic values of early Joseon period art."
Seated Male Carrying Maize,14th - 16th Century,Null,Sculpture,"This figure probably represents an Aztec deity-either Macuilxochitl or Xochipilli-whose domain was beauty, the arts, and such pleasures as gameplaying, dancing, and sex. Both names include the Aztec word for ""flower,"" and in one hand the figure holds a cone of flowers, perhaps the blossoming crown of a cactus. For the Aztecs, flowers signified beauty, refinement, and fertility in general and sexuality in particular. The burden of maize cobs on his back also may allude to his creative energies."
Pair of Figure in Flower Ornaments,6th - 10th Century,Null,Jewelry,"Figures within flowers are one of the most enchanting themes of the Maya ceramic art of Jaina, an island off the western Yucatán coast. The figures, usually males who cross their arms over their bodies, are either radiantly youthful or aged (as here), suggesting a relationship to the life cycle."
Seated Deity,14th - 16th Century,Null,Sculpture,"The crested headdress with tassels suggests that this youthful, seated male is Macuilxochitl (Five Flower), an Aztec supernatural patron of many forms of pleasure, among them music, dance, feasting, games, and sex. His cult was popular among common people, and this effigy probably was created for use in a small neighborhood temple. The stone surface could have been plastered and then brightly painted."
Flower Embroidery Design for Silk Manufactory of Lyon,18th Century,France,Drawing,"This drawing features a floral design intended for use by the silk manufactory in Lyon, a city with a long tradition in this industry. Jean Baptiste Pillement’s chalk drawings were translated not only into fabric, but also prints, which circulated and spread his style widely. Here, he used a small range of colors and repeated forms to create an appealing decorative motif."
Large Dish with Artichokes,16th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Ceramic vessels and tiles produced in Iznik, Turkey, for the Ottoman court in Istanbul represented the finest Islamic ceramics. Floral and vegetal motifs are a hallmark of Iznik pottery. The center of this dish is covered in a dynamic artichoke motif interwoven with rosettes and serrated saz leaves. The artichoke design was likely inspired by luxury Italian textiles imported into the Ottoman court. The dish represents a high point of Ottoman art during the reign of Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent (1520–66) in which European, Persian, Chinese, and Egyptian influences contributed to a distinct artistic language."
Flowering Crab Apple,16th Century,China,Painting,"Shen Zhou painted a broken branch (zhezhi 折枝) of crab apple, a fragment of nature rather than the full plant in its natural context. Shen uses calligraphic outlines in pure ink to depict the flower petals. The swift yet precise brushstrokes together with the slight S-shaped branch convey vitality. The inscription is a poem written by the artist, commenting on the lovely color and melancholic aura of the crab apple blossom. Shen Zhou is the founder of the Wu School, a group of scholars and officials active around Suzhou in eastern China, known for practicing painting and calligraphy in a refined and elegant style."
Woman Wearing a Flower,20th Century,United States,Painting,
The Botanical Magazine or Flower Garden Displayed:  Umbel-Flowering Bulb-Bearing Orange-Lily,19th Century,England,Print,"England was central to botanical concerns in the 18th century. For example, Kew Gardens was founded in 1721 and became a major institution for knowledge about plants from every continent. Interest in gardening led William Curtis to found the specialized magazine Botanical Magazine: or Flower Garden Displayed in 1787. Curtis aimed “to illustrate and describe the most ornamental flowering plants including information on their cultivation and illustrations drawn from living plants and colored as near to nature as the imperfection of color will admit.”"
Border Fragment of a Shawl,19th Century,Null,Textile,"Green, yellow, red, blue, and white woolen threads were woven to create the instantly recognizable Kashmiri teardrop flower patterns on this shawl border. Such a work was part of a larger textile, which would have entranced the viewer with its complexity and vibrancy, especially as it moved with the wearer and contrasted with other articles of clothing."
Fluted Cup with Dragon Handle,14th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Very thinly potted, the subtly lobed body of this cup is almost translucent. The thin, slightly opaque, light greenish glaze lends a sugary shine. Applied elements, including the handle, beaded borders, and sculptural floret, are constructed and glazed with the same materials as the body, providing a seamless blend of form and decorative embellishment. The result is an evocative reminder of slightly earlier silver cups, also created in the form of flowers. This pristine, natural construction is challenged, however, by the archaic dragon that acts as the handle. Borrowed from the decoration found on much earlier bronzes, this added form illustrates the eclecticism of the Yuan, the attempt to blend present vision with interest in the past."
London Types: Flower Girl,19th Century,England,Print,"London Types celebrates the affection residents felt for their city at the end of the 19th century. The series includes many depictions of women because the publisher William Heinemann, a strong supporter of the struggle for equality, advised the artist to represent both sexes equally. The scenes document London of the 1890s with contemporary references."
Persian Flowers,18th Century,France,Print,"Jean Baptiste Pillement was one of the most influential designers of the Rococo period, known for his varied and prolific chinoiseries (European variants of Chinese and Japanese motifs). His designs were spread throughout Europe primarily via their translation into prints. This print is one of a set of six etched by Pillement himself. Each depicts a so-called “Persian” flower, largely fantasies, presenting strange, alienlike floral forms that could be adapted to various uses from textiles to wall decorations."
"Flowers of Four Seasons, with Poems",16th Century,China,Painting,"In this painting, flowers are loosely arranged by the seasons: narcissus and peony represent early spring; yellow loquat and lotus, summer; chrysanthemum, autumn; and the plum and evergreen bamboo, winter. The artist added to each flower a poetic line of calligraphy associating each plant with a historic or legendary figure. For example, the chrysanthemum, along with the line “The untrammeled joy at the eastern fence,” refers to the poet Tao Yuanming (died AD 427) who enjoyed chrysanthemums at the eastern fence in his garden. The scroll illustrates Wang Guxiang’s mastery of free brushwork, combining light monochrome ink with transparent colors. In his inscription, Wang says he used the “boneless” style without outlines as developed during the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). Wang was a native of Changzhou, a city in southeast China known for its rich flora and fauna, and flower-and-bird painting tradition."
Bowl with Lotus Petal Design in Relief,13th Century,Null,Ceramics,"As early as the seventh century, the practice of drinking tea and wine became an important part of elite leisure culture in Korea. A wide bowl like this example was especially suitable for drinking powdered tea shaved from a compressed tea cake, the most commonly enjoyed type during the Goryeo period. The outer wall of this tea bowl is decorated with the image of lotus flower, a symbol of purity."
Pair of Flower Pots (Pots de fleurs),18th Century,France,Ceramics,"The mark on this piece indicates that it was made after the Mennecy factory was moved to Bourg-la- Reine in 1773. The tradition of Mennecy's decoration on soft-paste porcelain can be recognized in the piece, but its style has been modified in response to the emerging neo-classic taste. The flowers are now organized into formal garland's and motifs of classical origin, such as the lion's heads, are introduced."
Quails and Sparrows in an Autumn Scene,14th Century,China,Painting,"The flower-and-bird subjects here are depicted in a meticulous manner, echoing the academic tradition but translating the customarily colored images to plain monochrome. Fine ink lines combined with carefully graded washes define the contours and give subtle modeling to the natural forms. Wang Yuan excelled in flower-and-bird subjects as well as landscape and figure paintings. A child prodigy, he was instructed by the great Yuan master Zhao Mengfu at an early age."
Bodhidharma Crossing the Yangzi on a Reed,14th Century,Null,Painting,"Chan Buddhism was introduced to China in the early 500s by the Indian monk Bodhidharma, or Puti Damo (died before 534). Upon his arrival in China, Bodhidharma was allegedly granted an audience with the Liang dynasty emperor Wu (reigned 502–49). Realizing the emperor did not understand his mission, the monk left Nanjing, crossed the Yangzi on a reed, and settled north in Henan province’s Shaolin monastery. Here, Bodhidharma is sketched in few pale brushstrokes. The diluted and swift lines on an empty ground emphasize the Chan idea that all things are illusionary. The inscription reads: Wind rises from the reed flowers, the waves are high; It’s a long way to go beyond the cliff of the Shaoshi mountain; Above the worlds of kalpas a flower is opening into five petals; So that your barefoot heels are just fine for the whipping rattans. —translated by Wai-Kam Ho"
Floral-shaped Cup and Saucer with Inlaid Chrysanthemum Design,12th - 13th Century,Null,Ceramics,"In Korea, chrysanthemum flowers and leaves were made into both tea and wine. Chrysanthemum wine was enjoyed during the the Double Nine Festival (the ninth day of the ninth month in the lunar calendar) praying for longevity.The flower design on the saucer is less delicate than the cup, suggesting that the cup and saucer originally were not related to each other."
Egret and Reeds,19th Century,Korea,Painting,"In this hanging scroll, an egret walks along the shores of a salt marsh where reeds abundantly grow. Native to Pyongyang, the artist Yang Ki-hun had no rival in bird-and-flower themes. The Taedong River estuary, one of Pyongyang’s beloved natural sites, may have been Yang’s favorite spot to observe and sketch various water birds.Yang treated his subjects of flora and fauna with an observant naturalist’s view, yet his choice of subjects—an egret and reeds—is deeply rooted in traditional symbolic language: the egret stands for the scholarly reclusive life, while reeds indicate humility and modesty."
The Botanical Magazine or Flower Garden Displayed:  White Cape - Coast Lily,19th Century,England,Print,"England was central to botanical concerns in the 18th century. For example, Kew Gardens was founded in 1721 and became a major institution for knowledge about plants from every continent. Interest in gardening led William Curtis to found the specialized magazine Botanical Magazine: or Flower Garden Displayed in 1787. Curtis aimed “to illustrate and describe the most ornamental flowering plants including information on their cultivation and illustrations drawn from living plants and colored as near to nature as the imperfection of color will admit.”"
Vase with Golden Pheasants,18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"The flower-and-bird painting in this vase was intricately executed in colored enamels (falangcai), with careful modeling, shading, and blending of colors reflecting European influences through missionary-artists at the Qing court. The Jesuit artist Giuseppe Castiglione (1688–1766), in particular, exerted tremendous impact at the Qianlong academy."
A Beauty,19th Century,Japan,Painting,"Many ukiyo-e paintings and prints focus on bijin (美人), or “beautiful people.” Female courtesans and entertainers were the main draw in the pleasure district of Edo (now Tokyo), but young men were also available. The poem here reads as follows: ""The full blooming cherry / is not the only flower worth mentioning. / The color of the young plum tree / blooms as well.""The full blooming cherry is a metaphor for mature women, and the plum for young men."
Flowers in a Vase,17th Century,Netherlands,Painting,"With just a few flowers, Verelst created a composition of great sophistication and balance. A simple glass flask is filled with a large rose, a red anemone, and a white narcissus tinged with pink. These flowers are surrounded by a scattering of smaller blossoms. Like many still-life painters, Verelst depicted a window reflected in the glass vase, but here he did not show the window's precise structure. He did, however, use another common device: the depiction of a few chips in the stone surface to make the material seem more tangible. Early in his career, Verelst moved from Holland to London, where he worked for the court of King James II and was extravagantly praised for the realism of his flower paintings."
Florilegium (A Book of Flower Studies),17th Century,Null,Books,
Pitcher,12th Century,Null,Ceramics,"The chrysanthemum is the flower of autumn. In East Asia, its wine was believed to bring longevity if drunk during the Double Nine Festival (September 9). ""Drinking Wine,"" a poem by Tao Yuanming (365–427), combines the flower with the theme of the reclusive life: ""From the eastern fence, I pluck chrysanthemum flowers, and idly look toward the southern hills."" In Korea, the chrysanthemum was established as a popular motif for Goryeo inlaid celadon as early as the 1100s. The flower was used as the main motif for wine service vessels in particular. When Koreans drank wine from Goryeo celadon decorated with chrysanthemum designs, they believed that Tao’s faithful spirit transferred to their inner mind, as did the blessings of longevity."
Container for Flowers,20th Century,Japan,Ceramics,"This flattened hexagonal flower vase showcases the brilliant coloration that can be achieved through wood firing: scorching produced the flash of orange on the surface. Although this piece is a traditional form for holding flowers, Kohyama has also produced more sculptural works that are intended for the same purpose."
Sketchbook #1: Flower (page 64),20th Century,United States,Books,"Hewit prepared carefully for the lithograph Old Man, as this is one of four drawings of the sitter in Sketchbook No. 1."
Square Jar with Birds and Flowers,17th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This lidded square jar was likely paired with a complementary yet nonidentical mate. The pine tree, plum, and bamboo together form the frequently depicted motif known as the Three Friends of Winter (shōchikubai), so named because of their hardy perseverance in the cold. Each side also features a pair of birds, including cranes on one face and pheasants on another."
Flowers and Vegetables,19th Century,United States,Print,"This lithograph served as an advertisement for the seeds sold at James Vick in Rochester, New York, a leading American nursery center in the latter half of the 19th century. An auxiliary business, the production of fruit and flower prints aided nurserymen and their travelling salesmen. At first the lithographs were hand colored, but in 1871 a local company began to print in color. Lithographs are made by drawing a design onto a stone with a greasy crayon; water adheres to the bare stone while the printing ink sticks to the greasy areas. The process was invented at the end of the 18th century and was often used after about 1820 because it is a speedy and inexpensive medium, producing more impressions compared to other tonal techniques such as mezzotint, aquatint, and stipple."
Divine couple seated in a lotus blossom,19th Century,Null,Painting,"A gigantic, thousand-petaled lotus flower provides an intimate setting for the lovers. They sit on the seed pod of another full-blown lotus flower, which indicates their transcendent nature by elevating them from the mire of the earth. Shown with full face forward in all white, the four-armed male deity has the all-seeing third eye in his brow and holds only a manuscript. The red goddess on his lap grasps a lotus flower in one hand, which communicates her benign and peaceful nature. At the bottom are offerings of flowers, incense, oil lamps, and jeweled cups of pure water or liquor."
Bird on a Flowering Branch,12th Century,Null,Painting,"A male redstart, a type of small bird, sits hunched on the branch of a flowering plum tree in early spring. The bird’s plumage is rendered in fine detail with a great naturalistic sense, characteristic of Southern Song court painting. While redstarts tend to spend the winter in warmer climates, they may have been seen during the mild winters in China’s southeast in Hangzhou, the seat of the former imperial painting academy where this album leaf was presumably produced. The small square painting must have once been part of an album. When collected in Japan, it was mounted as a hanging scroll, presumably to fit it in an alcove to be enjoyed during the tea ceremony."
Dishes with Flowers,20th Century,Japan,Ceramics,Seifū Yohei IV’s dishes with flowers feature underglaze yellow.
Flower Pot and Flowers,19th Century,England,Ceramics,
Mandarin Ducks and Flowering Plants,19th Century,Japan,Print,"In Asian painting, ducks are usually shown in pairs because a male and female mate for life. They symbolize fidelity and tranquility. The presence of another duck is suggested here by the gesture of the bird's head. Notice the variety of brushstrokes and ink tones used to depict the duck's plumage. The bird and flower genre is a popular theme in the paintings and prints of the Kelvin Smith Collection. Kachoga, or bird and flower pictures, became popular among collectors in Japan during the 19th century, due in large part to Hiroshige. Although better known for his landscape prints, Hiroshige made several exceptional prints of birds, plants, and animals that reveal his keen observation of nature."
Flower of Erebus,20th Century,United States,Sculpture,
"Festival of Flowers, Nice (Fête des fleurs)",20th Century,France,Painting,"While living in Nice after World War I, Matisse adopted a more relaxed style saturated with the warm colors of the Mediterranean. This painting depicts the view from the balcony of Matisse's room at the Hôtel de la Meditérranée overlooking the Promenade des Anglais in Nice. Pictured on the balcony are Matisse's daughter, Marguerite, and his model, Henriette, poised to toss their flowers to the participants in the parade below."
The Geldzahler Portfolio:  A Flower in the Forest,20th Century,United States,Portfolio,"This is one of ten prints in the Geldzahler portfolio (the others are by Francesco Clemente, Dennis Hopper, Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly, Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist, David Salle, Frank Stella, and David Hockney). The set, which commemorates Henry Geldzahler, curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, and ardent champion of contemporary art, was produced to benefit AIDS research."
Birds and Flowers,19th Century,Null,Painting,"The image depicted on this folding screen is not executed in ink, but rather a method called “pyrography"" or ""nakhwa,” a technique of burning the surface of materials ranging from wood to paper with the delicately controlled application of a heated metal tool. This technique became widely popular in the 19th century. Scorched marks here replace brush strokes. Nakhwa method is now designated as a Korean Intangible Cultural Asset by the Korean government."
"Fish and Flower and Female Buddha (Sakana, Hana to Butsujo)",20th Century,Japan,Woodblock,"Munakata cut away what he did not want to print. Whatremains in relief--that is, the raised portions of the carved woodblock--is inked and printed. Printing reverses the image."
"Fish and Flower and Female Buddha (Sakana, Hana to Butsujo)",20th Century,Japan,Drawing,"Executed quickly with brush and ink, this sketch captures the artist’s first inspiration. Since Munakata did not slavishly follow his preparatory drawings when he carved the woodblock, they only give a general idea of the final image."
Vase with Chi-Dragon Handles and Flowers and Birds,18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This four-sided vase with ovoid body, spreading foot, and short neck is decorated with birds, trees, and flowers in various enamels. The two dragon handles are decorated with floral designs in gold on a rouge-de-fer ground."
Portrait of Mary Wise,18th Century,England,Painting,"Mary’s modest and contemplative demeanor is a counterpoint to a rather elaborate ensemble consisting of a gown embroidered with gold flower sprigs, trimmed with lace and pearls, and tied with a gold sash, as well as a gold-striped veil and a bracelet with eight gold bands. Gainsborough’s compact oval format and the sitter’s informal pose lend this portrait an air of intimacy."
Tub-shaped Flower Pot,18th Century,France,Ceramics,
Flowering Bush above an Eroded Bank,16th Century,Italy,Drawing,"Federico Barocci, who worked in Urbino, made landscape sketches for use in his paintings and as independent studies. The artist’s multimedia approach—combining chalks, ink washes, and opaque paints—was novel at the time but would become standard practice for landscape artists working in later centuries. Novel, as well, was his interest in excerpts of the natural world rather than fully realized scenes. Here, the artist drew an eroded bank with a few bold lines in black chalk, then used a brush to layer brown and white ink washes, capturing the untamed clump of earth with remarkable naturalism."
Birds and Flowers in a Landscape of the Four Seasons,16th Century,Japan,Painting,"The monk-painter Sesshp is revered today, as he was in his own time. While he left Kyoto's sophisticated intel-lectual and cultural environment to live in a provincial village in a far western province, he seems never to have severed contacts with the monastic communities of his young adulthood. His residence in Yamaguchi proved fortuitous because his patron, the region's military lord, enjoyed considerable freedom in conducting trade missions overseas with Korea and China. Sesshp went to China in 1467 and traveled about the country, visiting well-known historical sites and Chan (Zen) temples before returning two years later. Thus he became familiar with contemporary painting practices, materials, formats, and subject matter. His assimilation and then transmission of these elements had a profound impact on the following generations of ink painters, patrons, and Zen communities throughout Japan. Despite the presence on these byøbu of the name ""Sesshp,"" they are from the hand of another accom-plished but as yet anonymous follower active in the middle of the sixteenth century. Sesshp's name here, as on a handful of similar bird-and-flower byøbu, attests to the master's identification at that time with the colorful mural paintings on the same theme emanating from Ming dynasty China. This genre had heretofore been relegated to hanging scroll compositions, so the intro-duction into temple and daimyo residences of such an attractive theme surely caused considerable excitement in the later fifteenth century, when in all likelihood Sesshp introduced it into the Japanese painting reper-toire. Subsequently, artists of varying backgrounds and training tried their hands at these large, dramatic scenes. From right to left the composition portrays an array of flowering plants in the near distance that indicate the passage of the seasons. Birds, usually paired, occupy this setting, engaged in various activities that lend naturalism and an air of peacefulness. The world they inhabit may be characterized pictorially by expansive middle-ground waterscapes that end where the far distant mountains rise as backdrops. These features appear consistently in other bird-and-flower byøbu attributed to Sesshp. Also noteworthy is the absence of any birds of prey such as the samurai's beloved hawks, emblems of fierceness and graceful strength that appear often in the byøbu of sixteenth-century Kano and Soga school painters."
Ink Plum,15th Century,China,Painting,"Seasonal paintings, including those depicting flowering plum trees in early spring, furnished scholars’ studios or other interior spaces in the house. Peng Xu is considered the foremost follower of the famous plum blossom painter Wang Mian (1287–1359) (see CMA 1974.26). The branches are brushed in the same vigorous manner leaving white streaks in the ink indicating the gnarled bark. The delicate blossoms are drawn in fine lines, while a gray wash covers the entire surface, only leaving the flower petals in reserve."
Votive Hanging with Image of Kannon (Kannon Kakebotoke),14th Century,Null,Sculpture,"Kakebotoke (literally “hanging Buddhist deities”) like this appeared from the latter part of the Heian period. They often hung on the doors of a Shinto shrine hall to indicate the Buddhist manifestation of the god, or kami, inside, or along the eaves of a Buddhist temple hall to indicate the Buddhist deity celebrated there."
Under Ekvatorn (Beneath the Equator),20th Century,Sweden,Textile,"Though this pattern is titled Under Ekvatorn or Beneath the Equator, the design and textile were both produced in Sweden. Frank’s use of brightly colored flowers on a black background suggests a warm equatorial environment brimming with vitality."
Gilded Dish with Flowers and Leaves,16th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This floral design highlights the rich red, the most difficult to achieve in ceramics, that was developed by Turkish potters. The design is divided with a central swaying saz leaf, with red roses, blue hyacinths, and other floral elements enhanced with glittering gold, a feature that rarely survives. The rim displays a simplified “rock and wave” design adopted from Chinese ceramics which were abundant in the imperial Topkapi Palace in Istanbul"

A Woman Putting Flowers in Her Hair,18th Century,Italy,Portrait Miniature,"Scholars generally agree that Rosalba Carriera (1675-1757) developed the art of painting miniatures on ivory, in place of the traditional support of vellum, a fine animal skin. Although she became famous as a pastel painter, in her early career, Carriera decorated ivory snuff boxes-containers used to hold powdered tobacco taken by sniffing up the nostrils-for tourists. This miniature likely served as a lid to a snuff box, due to its elliptical shape in contrast to the oval or occasionally round shapes of most other miniatures. Although painters of ivory snuff boxes used watercolor, the same media artists used on vellum, the finished images on ivory were crude in comparison to those painted on vellum because ivory presents a greasy, non-absorbent surface, causing watercolor to run. Carriera revolutionized the art of watercolor painting on ivory through a process she termed her fondelli, or foundation. She developed a way in which to work in watercolor on ivory that emulated the soft powdery sophistication of her pastels. She used opaque gouache, essentially watercolor paint mixed with a gummy white, a combination of media which adhered to the oily surface of ivory. News of Carriera's innovation spread through Europe, and in the first few decades of the 1700s, most miniaturists abandoned vellum in favor of ivory."
Chinese Flower,19th Century,United States,Drawing,
Woolen carpet with millefleurs decoration,17th Century,Null,Carpet,"Pashmina, a very fine fiber made from the fleece of Himalayan goats, was a material highly valued at the Mughal courts. Luxury rugs functioned in several ways, including as insulators for palatial and ceremonial spaces and as framing devices for important figures. In a biography of the Mughal emperor Akbar (reigned 1556–1605), called the Ain-i-Akbari, the court historian Abu’l Fazl (1551–1602) poetically wrote that such textiles created “a beautiful flowerbed.” The description is apt, as this carpet features an impressively symmetrical floral design known as millefleurs, or “thousand flowers” in French. Viewing several of these carpets and other hangings at once would have been visually impressive for court attendees."
Pendant with Shri,2nd Century,Null,Jewelry,"A conflation of local and Hellenistic divinities, this goddess exemplifies abundance and prosperity. Like Tyche, she holds a cornucopia, overflowing with fruits and bounty, but it is in the form of a lotus flower, associated with the local Indian goddess of good fortune, Shri. To further emphasize this association, she holds a lotus flower in her right hand as well."
Insects and Flowers,20th Century,Null,Painting,"More than 26 feet long, this scroll presents insects, reptiles, and plants in delicate brushwork and pale colors, referring in style to earlier Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279) bird-and-flower paintings. Upon closer inspection, ants dismember a butterfly and reptiles wait to ambush their prey.An inscription at the end of the painting gives us an idea of its meaning: Attributed to the Qing dynasty scholar Zhang Xigeng (張錫庚, 1801–1861), the inscriber relates the work to an earlier painting by Qian Xuan (錢選, c. 1235–before 1307) and further suggests that the painting may allude to the relentlessness of natural selection. By drawing a parallel to tumultuous episodes in Chinese history, the writer might even hint at the domestic rebellions and the aggression of Western powers against China in his lifetime, particularly the Opium Wars (1839–60)."
Bowl with Flowering Vines Design in Relief,12th - 13th Century,Null,Ceramics,"As early as the seventh century, the practice of drinking tea and wine became an important part of elite leisure culture in Korea. A wide bowl like this example was especially suitable for drinking powdered tea shaved from a compressed tea cake, the most commonly enjoyed type during the Goryeo period. The image of flowering vines in relief on the inner wall of this tea bowl must have made the moment of drinking tea more enjoyable."
Pendant,18th Century,Null,Jewelry,"The central emerald has been subtly incised with a many-petaled lotus flower, a symbol of the sun, suggesting the radiance of the outsize gem. The enameling on the back depicts a peacock with a pair of peahens amid flowers. Peacocks signal the monsoon rains. The refined use of enamel indicates that this piece was assembled in the specialized workshops of Jaipur, but the size of the emerald suggests that it was made for imperial use."
"Album of Miscellaneous Subjects, Leaf 2",17th Century,China,Painting,"Leaf 2 This leaf is, perhaps, based on Du Mu's poetic line: The herdboy pointed to the distant Apricot Village. Han Tan's colophon reads: A thousand feet of red cliffs look like a sculptured flower of furong; In one glance, the long bridge joins adjacent ridges. Furthermore a wine shop stands in a bamboo grove; The fellow who bought some good wine is drunk on the eastern shore of the stream."
Section of Monolithic Railing with Bather and Lotus Medallions,2nd - 3rd Century,Null,Sculpture,"Railings demarcated a sacred space, such as a tree shrine or a stupa. Images associated with purifying waters were carved on the railings, as if to symbolically cleanse those who passed through the gate. Under a fruit-bearing tree is a young woman squeezing water from her hair. In a visual depiction of an ancient Indian poetic trope, a goose mistakes the drops of water for pearls and comes to eat them."
Flowers and Grasses,17th Century,Japan,Painting,"Kitagawa Sōsetsu painted for the Maeda family, powerful rulers of what is present-day Ishikawa Prefecture on the central northern coast of Honshū, Japan’s main island. Screens served as room dividers and backdrops in Maeda grand residences. This composition is considered one of the artist’s masterpieces. Kitagawa Sōsetsu is thought to have been a student of Tawaraya Sōsetsu, who was in turn the student of Tawaraya Sōtatsu the Kyoto-based master painter regarded as the creator of the style that came to be known as Rinpa. By selecting a painter of this lineage, the Maeda family consciously connected their aesthetics to those of the imperial capital as a means of proclaiming their elevated status."
Avatamsaka Sutra No. 78,14th Century,Null,Books,"This illuminated manuscript presents one part of the multivolume sacred text titled Avatamsaka (Flower Garland) sutra. Both the script and the image are rendered in gold ink on the smooth surface of the dark blue, indigo-dyed mulberry paper. This portion of the text, which reads from right to left, describes the encounter of the Buddha of the Future (Maitreya) and the young pilgrim Sudhana. The Buddha gives his words of wisdom to Sudhana, who asks questions about the path toward spiritual awakening. Mixed with ink and glue, the gold has a brilliance that strikingly reflects Sudhana’s ardent quest for understanding the way to reach enlightenment."
"Christ Gathering Roses, Centerpiece of an Altar Cloth(?)",15th Century,Null,Embroidery,"The altar cloth was probably made for a southern German convent in the 15th century. While the focus on the Christ child is typical for female spirituality in the late Middle Ages, there are no comparative examples for the Christ child picking flowers. The detailed depiction of plants and flowers is of unusual quality for the embroideries of this period."
Exotic Flower (Fleur exotique),19th Century,France,Print,
Fang Xuanling Pedestal,7th Century,Null,Sculpture,"This double lotus pedestal exhibits the rich, ornate style of early Tang sculpture. It was commissioned by the Duke of Liang, Fang Xuanling (578–648), for the blessing of his second son and daughter-in-law, the Tang imperial princess of Gaoyang. The iconography and inscription suggest that it originally went with a statue, now missing, of Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha, instead of Amitayus.Today the pedestal is topped with Amitayus, the Buddha of Infinite Life, seated in meditation. Although the pedestal was not made with the statue, the combination is faithful to the original artistic conception."
De Poolse Muts,17th Century,Netherlands,Drawing,"Still-life painting began in the Northern Netherlands (present-day Holland) around the turn of the 1600s. Still-life painter Balthasar van der Ast made this precise botanical study of a pink carnation as a reference that he could add later to a painting of an elaborate bouquet of flowers. Van der Ast inscribed the name “The Polish Cap,” on the sheet to suggest that the flower came from foreign lands."
Mural Fragment with Elite Male and Maguey Cactus Leaves,6th Century,Null,Painting,"This richly dressed elite male belonged to a row of identical figures who processed along the walls of a patio in one of Teotihuacán’s wealthy apartment compounds. He offers a chant or prayer, materialized in a mouth scroll, along with a flower-filled libation that cascades from one hand. In the other hand, he carries an incense bag. The thorny spines of the maguey cactus, in front and behind, may allude to the offering of precious blood and a ritual beverage made from the cactus’s sap (pulque, a less refined form of tequila). The spines are thrust into objects that may represent bundles or plots of land."
Flowers and Trees of the Four Seasons,18th Century,Japan,Painting,"The painter Watanabe Shikō had a special interest in scientific realism, based on interactions with his patron Konoe Iehiro. Shikō combined his attention to accurate depiction of plants with strong ink outlines and decorative elements like gold and silver, arriving at an innovative style that influenced many of his peers in the city of Kyoto."
Lilies and Sparrow,20th Century,United States,Drawing,"Joseph Stella made nature studies throughout his career. For this simple, spare composition he used metalpoint, a medium associated with the Italian Renaissance and rarely seen in the 20th century. Although metalpoint cannot be erased, its unique qualities -- precision, delicacy, and sharpness -- appealed to Stella and he often combined it with colored pencils to achieve a brightness that resembled oil painting. The careful execution and large size of this sheet suggest that Stella considered it a finished work of art."

Star Flower,19th Century,United States,Drawing,
Clock,20th Century,Russia,Timepiece,"The use of Russian hardstones in creating precious objects became a hallmark of design from the House of Fabergé. Easily carved, these minerals were sourced largely from the western region surrounding the Ural Mountains. Fabergé's workmasters used colorful stones such as agate, lapis lazuli, rock crystal, rhodonite, and nephrite (jade), seen here in this small desk clock, to create and embellish flower studies, animal figures, and all manner of luxurious accessories."
Dark Flower,20th Century,Germany,Drawing,
Flower of the Air,20th Century,France,Print,
Cruciform Mirror with Six Blossoms,10th - 12th Century,Null,Metalwork,"This cross-shaped mirror has a simple wide frame and a small knob. A part of the floral pattern surrounding the knob has been compromised, likely due to poor casting or damage. The mirror is decorated with designs of flower branches and leaves, which encapsulate six flowers. A few of these branches protrude beyond the beaded circular border to touch the edge of the outer circle, adding a playful dynamism. Similar motifs can be found on silver objects and porcelain of this period."
The Beach at Sumiyoshi from the Tales of Ise,17th Century,Japan,Painting,"The poem written on the painting comes from The Tales of Ise, a 10th-century poetic narrative of love: In autumn the wild geese cry And chrysanthemums are in flower, Yet how pleasant to dwell By the sea in springOn the Beach of Sumiyoshi."

Those auspicious divinities personify the life-giving forces of nature. Here the groom becomes a personification of wealth and abundance, his clothing updated to accord with the fashions of the day."

Krishna Receives a Flower Garland,18th Century,India,Painting,
Flowers and Rocks,14th - 17th Century,Null,Painting,"Here, the painter uses delicate brushwork and vivid colors to depict an early summer scene of three kinds of flowers growing beside a garden rock: From top to bottom we see flowering pomegranate, then peonies, and lilies below. Like the peony, which conveys wishes for wealth and prosperity, the pomegranate flower, here in festive red color turning soon into fruit with many seeds, is associated with the wish for many sons. The lily, in Chinese ""baihe,"" is a homophone with the pun ""togetherness for a hundred years,"" expressing wishes for harmony and unity. The scroll would have made a suitable gift to married women."
"Krishna Quells the Serpent Kaliya, from a Bhagavata Purana",18th Century,Null,Painting,"In the forest where Krishna lived as a youth among the cowherds, there was a great pool of water connected to the Yamuna River. The water had become toxic from the poison excreted by all the snakes living there, including the serpent Kaliya. Kaliya’s royal residence is depicted at the lower right. In order to make the pool usable for drinking and bathing, Krishna tamed the serpent king by dancing on his heads. Krishna then persuaded him to move away to the ocean."
"Vishnu on Ananta, the Endless Serpent",18th Century,Null,Painting,"Before the creation of the world, the god Vishnu was asleep on the serpent Ananta, floating on the cosmic ocean. When the time came for him to create the world, Vishnu’s wife Lakshmi woke him gently by massaging his feet. Then, out of his navel emerged a lotus flower, and Vishnu gave birth to Brahma, the god of creation. As plants that grow in water, lotus flowers indicate the presence of the waters and their life-affirming capacity. In this painting they are boldly distributed over a deep brown background with basket-weave patterning."

Sunflower Studies,20th Century,United States,Drawing,"Charles Burchfield made numerous studies of dead sunflowers, focusing on the leaning and twisted forms of the plant. In these drawings, he hoped to capture the contrast of a flower that he saw as “gloriously alive . . . at the height of its vigor . . . [which] nevertheless seems more alive . . . when quite dead.”"

Clock,20th Century,Russia,Timepiece,"The use of Russian hardstones in creating precious objects became a hallmark of design from the House of Fabergé. Easily carved, these minerals were sourced largely from the western region surrounding the Ural Mountains. Fabergé's workmasters used colorful stones such as agate, nephrite (jade), lapis lazuli, rock crystal, and rhodonite, seen here in this small desk clock, to create and embellish flower studies, animal figures, and all manner of luxurious accessories. Bright pink rhodonite was among the rarest, and consequently most expensive, specimens used by the House of Fabergé."
"Panel with Birds, Flowers, and Suns",16th - 17th Century,Null,Lace,"The repeated sun and cross motifs, representing Christ and the Crucifixion, suggest this lace panel may have been used to ornament a Christian vestment, perhaps worn by a clergy member."
Child Carrying Fruit and Flowers,18th - 19th Century,France,Sculpture,"French sculptor Claude Michel, called Clodion, frequently depicts children in his sculpture, in this case a convincing toddler, from her pout to her plump toes. The piece is constructed in terracotta, a common medium for Clodion. After firing, the unglazed color of the clay can vary widely; each of Clodion's statues has a slightly different hue. The figure has sustained a number of damages, but has recently been cleaned and repaired."
"Fluted Bowl with Dragon, Butterfly, and Flowers",18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"A dragon encircled by sprays of flowers and a butterfly enliven the interior of this fluted bowl. The exterior has similar decoration, with touches of gold on some petals. The flutes enhance both the visual and tactile experience; their tapered forms draw the eye from the edges inward and provide ridges for the hands."
Las Meninas,21st Century,United States,Sculpture,"Las Meninas draws on traditions throughout global art and culture to address issues surrounding the female body, race, beauty, and community. The work’s skirted form conjures figures from the Spanish Golden Age painting Las Meninas (1656) by Diego Velazquez, apparel worn in the Afro-Brazilian religious tradition candomblé, and Mousgoum buildings in Cameroon. The white-glazed terracotta torso, alluding to sacred and secular traditions of body painting, leads to a faceless head, incorporating both figuration and abstraction."
Pasture Rose (Rosa Carolina Corymbosa),19th Century,France,Drawing,"Born in Belgium, Pierre-Joseph Redouté was trained by his father and began a ten-year career as an itinerant artist at age 13. He joined his brother in Paris working on theater sets and decorations, but his true love was flower painting, such as this drawing. Redouté achieved an international reputation for his botanical illustrations and enjoyed a long, successful career."
Parshva,9th Century,Null,Sculpture,"Parshva is the 23rd of the 24 Jinas who achieved liberation. He is the only one who is depicted with a serpent. This sculpture was made for followers of the branch of Jainism called Digambara, who enforce the regulations of total nudity among those actively seeking liberation. The only adornment of his figure is the auspicious symbol on his chest and the wheels of righteousness on his palms. The stark form of thenude body standing in a posture of meditation is masterfully set off from the array of gods and serpent divinities who venerate him. He stands with his feet on a lotus pedestal, but his hierarchically tall form reaches to the heavens, where gods fly to honor him with flower garlands. Three umbrellas over his head indicate his status as a liberated being worthy of worship."

Basket of Anemones,20th Century,France,Painting,"Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso worked closely together in the invention of Cubism from 1908 to 1914. “We were like two mountain climbers roped together,” Braque recalled. They separated when Braque enlisted in the French army at the outbreak of WWI in August 1914. Following a severe head wound and hospitalization, he returned to painting in 1916, but worked alone developing a personal Cubist style concerned with complex spatial constructions, color relationships, and textured surfaces. The flowers and basket in this still life are flattened, pressed tightly against the upright forms in the background, and surrounded by an illusionistic shadow. A decorator’s comb was used to create the wood grain pattern in the tabletop."

"A Mughal Prince, Perhaps Danyal, Holding a Sprig of Flowers",16th Century,Null,Painting,"Prince Danyal (1527–1605), the emperor Akbar’s youngest son, is said to have been his favorite. Danyal served his father as a military officer, leading contingents to the Deccan plateau in southern India, until he succumbed to an untimely death of alcoholism; Akbar himself died later that year. Here, Danyal wears the thumb ring of an archer and grasps a white flower in his hand, recalling his epithet, Nosegay of Fortune’s Spring. In his right hand he holds prayer beads. A sword, knife, and dagger hang from his sash. This early Mughal portrait depicts him as he appeared in his mid-teens."
Large Bowl with Molded Decoration,14th - 15th Century,Null,Ceramics,"The lobed sides of this bowl open like a flower and rise to a solidly molded and pointed rim reminiscent of metalware. The bowl with a thick, shiny, jadelike green glaze was made by potters who mastered techniques to fire vessels of enormous sizes for the export market. Large bowls and plates were primarily shipped to the Middle East where they were used for banquets, in which food was traditionally offered in the center of a seated gathering."
"Noblewoman at a Jharokha Window Holding a Rose, from a Portraits of Women series",18th Century,Null,Painting,The term jaharoka refers to a window where royalty present themselves to the public.

Peppi's Flowers,20th Century,United States,Textile,"Called Peppi as a child, Joanne Segal Brandford created this ethereal work, influenced by such historic textiles as knotless netted bags of South America and European needle laces. In her words, ""as I became aware of the variety and strength of traditional netting throughout the world, I felt encouraged to continue and expand my own explorations. . . . Recently I have explored ideas of openess/closedness and of spatial ambiguity. Illusion, especially the question of shadow and substance (real/not real), has been of particular interest."" Having taken Dr. Sherman Lee’s first year-long course of Far Eastern art, the donor of Peppi’s Flowers admires this museum, where Peruvian textiles can be displayed along with contemporary fiber art."

Tulips,20th Century,France,Painting,"Henri Matisse, leader of the French Fauves (“Wild Beasts”), advocated the complete liberation of color from natural appearances and reducing formal elements to absolute essentials. “What I dream of,” he wrote, “is an art of balance, purity, and serenity.” In Tulips a vase of flowers floats mysteriously against fields of thinly applied turquoise, aqua, and lavender. While the colorful tulips express a joyful sentiment, the vase rests precariously on a planar shape, perhaps a tabletop. The uncertainty of the vase’s position as it extends over the edge, and whether the tabletop continues to the right through a plane of transparent color, together with the strange black rectangle in the background, inserts a contravening feeling of disquiet and visual tension into the time-honored genre of still-life painting."

"Bowl with Poppies, Tree Peony, and Flowering Mimosa",18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Developments in enamel technology led to new possibilities in polychrome decoration. Pinks appeared, lending their name to the new palette of overglaze colors (famille rose), and the addition of opaque white allowed painters to vary the value of pigments, enhancing the painterly quality of porcelain decoration. As on painted scrolls and album leaves, the image is accompanied with a poem, in this case: ""Branches come alive in the moonlight; Blossoms fill the autumn realms."""
Women enjoying the river at the forest’s edge (recto) and flowering marigold (verso),18th Century,India,Painting,"The image of young women at play, in association with water and the fruiting of trees, such as this mango, has been used in Indian art to signal the idea of prosperity and abundance. Rain clouds approach that will nourish the land. The pairs of women on the banks sample perfumes, and in front of them bowls made of leaves appear to hold jasmine flowers for adorning the hair. One woman smokes a hookah and looks on as two companions frolic in the rivulet. The palace’s white marble buildings are barely indicated in the far distance."
Royal Female Donor,16th Century,Null,Sculpture,"Carrying a lamp in one hand, this female figure draped in finery was probably included as the donor of a sculptural group. She wears a complex headdress consisting of a network of beads and plaques joined together, ending in a bell at her forehead and crowning a long cloth that reaches to her waist. Her position on a lotus flower may indicate the transcendent state she attained as a result of the karmic merit of her donation."
Herbaceous Peony,17th Century,China,Painting,"Yun Shouping came from Piling (modern Changzhou), Jiangsu province, a center of floral, plant, and insect painting. He had joined the anti-Manchu resistance, was briefly imprisoned, and witnessed the death of family members in 1644. Like other artists, Yun Shouping expressed his Ming loyalism in coded pictures. The peony, king of flowers, and a spring garden motif developed new meaning during the Qing dynasty. The inscription indicates that Yun turns the flower into a motif representing the glorious past. The herbaceous peonies here appear somewhat withered and pale, with faint reddish veins running through its broken branches, perhaps a coded message. The inscription reads, An old painting by an anonymous painter of the Northern Song Dynasty has five varieties of flowers painted in the boneless manner. Its colors are so beguiling and beautiful, that even after several hundred years its lead pigments are like new. The skill with which the ink and colors were applied and the subtlety of its composition find no equal among modern followers."

Covent Garden Labourers,19th Century,England,Photograph,"Covent Garden workers, whose day started before 5 a.m., were divided into job-workers or odd-men—who were paid for each parcel they delivered and thus received little income in the off-seasons—and a much smaller group of salaried workers who were paid year-round to create arrangements and stock and help run the stalls."
Merging Emerging,21st Century,United States,Painting,"After decades of working primarily in a figurative mode, Skuodas turned to pure abstraction only recently. Her art often addresses connections between the spiritual and physical realms; in her words, ""I believe our psyches are linked to the laws which manifest themselves in the formation of a flower, a snowflake, or a seashell.""Befitting its title, the painting's composition is structured, yet openended along its perimeter."

Bed cover with floral medallion pattern,17th - 18th Century,Null,Embroidery,"In the center, a blue and gold bird grasps the curling stem of a trilobed flower. Bright colors and dizzying patterns radiate from this medallion, creating a delicate garden set against a soft white ground. In changing light, the gilt- and silver-wrapped threads animate the entire textile.Techniques for creating metal-wrapped threads were introduced to Indian workshops in the early 1700s by Portuguese merchants, who frequently traded in Indian textiles. However, embroidery techniques have been in use on the subcontinent since ancient times, as evidenced by the discovery of bronze needles and the representation of textiles in sculpture and paintings."

Supports with Addorsed Figures,15th Century,Null,Sculpture,"These small pillars were part of the multitiered bases of stupas—sacred Buddhist monuments. The figures that faced toward the viewer are four-armed bodhisattvas—beings on the path to perfect enlightenment. The Tibetan syllable carved at the top of the moldings denotes the position where this piece belongs in the series of other small double-sided pillars. The figures on the opposite sides, facing the stupa and unseen by visitors, are figures of four-armed goddesses who make offerings of music or gifts to the stupa. On these examples, one plays a drum; the other holds a lotus.  The figures stand on the center of a lotus flower that emerges from an overflowoing pot of abundance. Such imagery indicates that the faithful veneration of this monument will bring productive and abundant good results."
Cosmetics Box with Chrysanthemums,14th Century,Null,Lacquer,"In China, the chrysanthemum was historically appreciated for its association with the Double Nine Festival and the reclusive life of the poet Tao Yuanming (AD 365-427). In Japan, the 16-petaled chrysanthemum came to symbolize the Japanese imperial family after Emperor Gotoba (1180-1239) chose the motif as his personal emblem, having it applied to his sword and everyday utensils. This box proves that the flower also appeared on lacquer wares as early as the Kamakura period."
Buddhist Vestment (Kesa),20th Century,Null,Garment,Kesa are Buddhist monastic robes that originated in India. The robes are named after the brown or saffron dye originally used in their production. The primary motif on this seven-paneled kesa is a long-tailed bird with a flower in its mouth. This motif was imported from Persia (present-day Iran) through China during the Nara period (710–794)and is interpreted as a positive symbol. The bird delivers happiness in its mouth.

Plate with Nandi in Center,19th Century,Null,Enamel,"Petal-shaped canopies filled with floral designs and birds encircle an image of Nandi, the white bull mount of the Hindu destroyer god Shiva. Together they form a lotus flower. The birds are individualized species, showing the care of the metalworker to depict nature in all its variety and splendor. The fowl include peacocks, parakeets, bluebirds, and possibly even Indian rollers. To make the birds’ wings and the details on Nandi, the artist used thin gold wire to create cells, called cloisons, that could then be filled with colored glass. Some of the red glass has been lost on the outer rim of the plate."
Studies of Flowers after Nature:  Spray of Flowers,Date Unknown,France,Print,"Crayon manner etching was invented in the 18th century to simulate the texture of chalk drawings, which were very popular at the time. A tool with toothed points of varying thicknesses set at irregular intervals and angles (mattoir) imitated the random character of grains of chalk on textured paper. Etudes de fleurs d’après nature demonstrates how prints propagated floral designs that could be used in the applied arts. Artisans designing textiles or decorating furniture, for instance, were inspired by the compositions found on prints."

Birds and Flowers Textile,20th Century,England,Textile,Familiar designs by Arts and Crafts architect C. F. A. Voysey were still popular in the 1920s. The Cleveland Museum of Art acquired this colorful textile in 1926 from a traveling exhibition of works from the 1925 Paris exposition.
Monk Mending Clothes in the Morning Sun (Chōyō Hotetsuzu),14th Century,Null,Painting,"This painting illustrates the Zen ideal of cultivating one’s spirit through all moments of life, from the mundane to the marvelous. The monk pictured is simply mending his robes, but it is a meditative activity. A “mending clothes” image would typically form a pair with another on the theme of “reading by moonlight.” While the seals on the painting were added at a later date, similar seals appear on other ink figures and bird-and-flower compositions."
Chrysanthemum,20th Century,Netherlands,Painting,"Fascinated by the complex structure of chrysanthemums, Mondrian painted these delicate flowers throughout his career. This single, frontal blossom recalls the stylized chrysanthemums of Japanese prints. Mondrian added the initials and date near the bottom edge sometime after painting the flower. Since he returned to this subject repeatedly, even during his later years, this painting may have been produced as late as 1942, the year Mondrian exhibited it in New York."
Flowers of a Hundred Worlds (Momoyogusa),20th Century,Japan,Drawing,This is the cover for a group of 22 preparatory drawings for Kamisaka Sekka's print series Flowers of a Hundred Worlds.
Mirror,5th Century BCE,Null,Metalwork,"Named for their figured handles, Greek caryatid mirrors may derive from similar types created in ancient Egypt many centuries earlier (like CMA 1983.196). Greek caryatid handles typically take the form of a beautiful, draped woman like this one, whether mortal or divine (perhaps the love goddess Aphrodite). Often, she holds a small offering, here a flower. The small, winged women (Nikai) flanking her are unusual among such mirrors, which often feature Erotes in this position. In antiquity, the unadorned disk would have been highly polished and reflective, and the figure would have stood on an integrated base."
Gooseberries on a Table,18th Century,Netherlands,Painting,"Coorte worked in Middelburg, a wealthy maritime city in the southern part of the Netherlands that fostered a poetic, scientific, and spiritual examination of the natural world. Gooseberries—a modest, local pleasure—could be picked in the wild, although Dutch gardeners in the 1600s were the first to cultivate them to improve their taste. The strong illumination gives the plant a stark grandeur, despite the small scale, and the dark background emphasizes the fruit's delicate translucency. The dessicated flower petals and waxy leaves contrast with the succulent gooseberries, with their skin on the verge of bursting."

This box retains its inkstone and water dropper, the latter of which has a design of the sun behind clouds—a contrast to the hydrangea flower in moonlight motif on the box’s lid."
Pair of Potpourri Vases with Covers,18th Century,France,Ceramics,"These vases were created to contain potpourri, a mixture of flowers, herbs, and spices emitting ambient fragrance. This specific function offered a particularly fertile ground for the development of French porcelain, as manufactories experimented with forms, surface ornamentations, and placement of perforations."
"Dish with Dragons, Pomegranates, and Peaches",17th - 18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Various techniques are applied to the decoration of susancai or ""plain three-color"" ware. The hidden dragons are incised, over which are painted decoration of fruit and flower sprays outlined with black pigment and colored with yellow, green, turquoise, and purplish brown enamels. The ground is filled with ivory enamel over unglazed clay."
"A Woman Charms Snakes in the Wilderness: Asavari Ragini, from a Ragamala",18th Century,Null,Painting,"Wearing a blouse and skirt made of leaves, the heroine retains her jewelry and diaphanous veil. She speaks to a snake, and others approach, charmed by her beauty. The multiple colors used for the rocks add to the otherworldly quality of the scene, and even they seem drawn to her spiritual magnetism."
Tong-Shaped Vase with Flowers and Grasses,20th Century,Japan,Ceramics,"Seifū Yohei III (1851–1914) was a son of the Maruyama school painter Okada Ryōhei (dates unknown). Though he studied painting, he ultimately succeeded his ceramics mentor, Seifū Yohei II (1845–1878), in Kyoto. He distinguished himself as a remarkable porcelain artist, taking Qing dynasty Chinese wares as his inspiration. He experimented widely with new glazing techniques. In 1893, he became the first ceramicist to be appointed as an Imperial Household Artist under a system introduced by the Japanese government in 1890. He produced many works for use in Chinese-style tea gatherings called sencha."
"Two Women Pluck Flowers on a Terrace: Gunakari Ragini, from a Ragamala",17th Century,Null,Painting,"A woman with dark complexion and her fair-skinned companion collect flowers in a white bowl from a plant growing in a golden pot. Two huge yellow bolsters set rakishly on the bed suggest restlessness inside the chamber. A gold box for breath-freshening betel (paan) is on the bed, and golden wine vessels are in the two turrets and on the roof, probably to be drunk while watching for her lover to arrive."
Duvor (Doves),20th Century,Sweden,Textile,"This mid-1900s design harkens back to royal Swedish taste around 1800. The subdued pastel color palette is distinctly Gustavian, referring to the reigns of two Swedish kings named Gustav in the late 1700s. The flower vase is evocative of ceramics produced by the Gustavsberg Porcelain Company in the 1800s and popular among Sweden’s aristocracy."

Flowers in Blue and Black Striped Vase,20th Century,United States,Drawing,"Baumann loved flowers and made many drawings (exemplified by House and Garden and Hollyhock Garden in this gallery) and several color woodcuts of gardens. He also painted vases of flowers in front of decorative octagonal or oval backgrounds, some of which he then executed as prints. Although, Flowers in Blue and Black Striped Vase was never translated into a color woodcut. Sunny Messengers, with a similar format, was made in 1915.   Sunny Messengers was included in the first exhibition of contemporary American woodblock prints. Organized by Baumann, the show opened at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1916. Color woodcuts were growing in popularity; Baumann’s prints won a gold medal at the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915."
Birds and Flowers,15th Century,Japan,Painting,"These two paintings are possibly by Sesshū Tōyō. They once flanked a central scroll with an ink landscape. The unbalanced nature of the compositions, however, suggests they may be images recycled from larger paintings. The one with sweet osmanthus and hibiscus is an autumn scene, the other is a summer scene with daylilies and gardenias. Folding screens often contrast two seasons or depict all four across a single pair of screens. Sesshū’s works were sufficiently prized that repurposing them in fragmentary form to display in an alcove of a luxurious room would not be an unusual choice."

The text here was often appended to the Kalpa-sutra, the most sacred book of Jainism. This story concerns the life of a Jain teacher named Kalaka, a prince who developed the ability to work magic after he become a monk, inspired by the teachings of a holy man.The painting on this page shows a monk clad in white, indicating his affiliation with the Shvetambara (“white clad”) branch of Jainism. It is the second to the last page of the manuscript and includes the beginning of the colophon, which contains information about when and where this manuscript was produced."
"Makaras, Phoenixes and Flowers",13th Century,Null,Textile,"Central Asian designers drew from a wide variety of motifs, both imaginary and real. In this silk, rows of soaring phoenixes alternate with rows of makaras. Combining a fish body and tail, wings, and a dragon's head, the makara originated in India as a water creature. With the spread of Buddhism, the motif migrated into the art of Central Asia and, from there, into the art of northern China. In Italy, exotic Central Asian patterns such as this inspired flights of imagination. One such example (seen in the photograph below) shows a creature, strikingly similar to the makara, spewing forth a dragon while a dog walks up its back."

A prophet-like shepherd figure with a staff at the upper left predicts that Rustam will be the savior of Iran. At the top of the page a feline has caught its prey, while a hunter steps on its tail. This extraordinary painting has more applications of marbled colorant than any other known example. Even all the flowers and birds have been articulated through marbling in a feat of registration and control by a master of the technique."

Summer Flowers,17th Century,Japan,Painting,"White hydrangea, orange-colored demon’s lantern, and greenbrier vine appear together in this scroll. The artist used the dripping-in (tarashikomi) technique to create a sense of depth and dimension in the leaves of the plants. A carefully controlled brush loaded with a high ratio of water to ink or color is key to the success of this brush method. Gold lines indicate the veins of leaves and the seams of pods."
Silk Sleeve Decoration with Hunters,8th Century,Null,Textile,"This silk sleeve blends technical and stylistic elements that occurred in early Islamic art. The sides of the sleeve are decorated with a lotus flower design, an ancient Egyptian motif that was absorbed into Hellenistic and Byzantine art. The upper panel displays a large medallion composed of leaves and palmettes, common vegetal motifs in Islamic art of this period. Below, the mace-wielding horseman is identified in Coptic inscriptions as Joseph, father of Jesus and saint within the Coptic faith. The image is likely derived from the Byzantine representation of the victorious emperor."
In Blue,20th Century,United States,Textile,"In his work, Jim Hodges reveals qualities of beauty and grace in the most unassuming materials. Through relatively simple acts of manipulation and reappraisal, he invests the man-made with a previously absent level of emotion and authenticity. In Blue is a diaphanous curtain of lush, tropical colors that is both imposing for its monumental scale and delicate in its fragility. Activated by the slightest breeze, its artificial elements ripple with the movement of natural life forms. To create In Blue, Hodges took apart hundreds of silk flowers, flattened and ironed each element, pinned the pieces together, and then carefully hand-sewed them into a scrim."

Identifying the blossoms only became customary in the late 18th century when a single piece of porcelain was decorated with one species, and flowers were represented along with leaves, stems, seed pods, and roots. All of this reflects Carolus Linnaeus’s recent invention of a scientific method to categorize all known flora. The decorations on the Derby factory’s products derive from contemporary English botanical publications. For instance, illustrations in William Curtis’s The Botanical Magazine served as models for the French marigold and nettle-leaved bell flower on the dessert service."

"Jar with Flowers, Rocks and Pheasants",17th - 18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"In the Qing dynasty, art reached a high standard of technical perfection despite a tendency for extravagance and exaggerated ornament. This jar with susancai (plain three-color) decoration uses shades of light green, purple, and yellow, but no red. The vase features a pair of pheasants looking at each other among flowering plants, such as peonies and magnolia. The porcelain painter used fine dark outlines in a more graphic style to delineate motifs, to texture rocks, and depict minute details such as holes in weathered leaves of plants."
Velvet panel with four youths smelling flowers,17th Century,Null,Velvet,"A new style depicting single figures with limited modeling and European artistic influence was spearheaded by the Iranian painter Riza ‘Abbasi and adopted by textile designers in sumptuous brocaded velvets. Even with faded colors, this grand length retains ten colors of velvet pile, a feat that Iranian velvet weavers achieved by skillfully replacing colored pile warp during weaving, and thereby creating the most colorful velvets in the world. Elegant youths dominate the simplified outdoor setting here with diminutive cypresses and silver ponds on a ground originally covered with gold thread. Fashionably dressed young men wear wide-brimmed hats, silver robes, stole-like scarves, and knotted sashes that are symbols of status and rank."
Side Table,17th Century,Null,Furniture,"Long, rectangular tables were often placed against a wall to hold candlestands, flower vases, or incense burners. It was customary to hang ancestor portraits, images of religious figures, or seasonal paintings above the table that would convey auspicious wishes and blessings to the family. The high legs show stylized cloud-shaped spandrels. At each end of the table, between the recessed legs, are carved openwork panels with a lively dragon motif."
Brocade with Lotus Flowers,13th - 14th Century,Null,Textile,"The tradition of brocade weaving in northern China continued after the Mongol conquest. However, the arrival of eastern Iranian craftsmen affected both the design and the structure of the brocades: patterns became symmetrical and paired warps replaced single warps. Both of these modifications can be observed in this example. At the same time, however, the Jin tradition of floating foundation wefts across the back sides of the brocaded areas continued. Brocades such as this may have been woven in Hongzhou (in Hebei province), where weavers from both western Asia and from the former Jin capital, Bianjing, are known to have worked together."
Cloth with Winged and Two-Tailed Animals,17th - 18th Century,Null,Lace,"Strange two-tailed animals accompanied by birds appear on the filet/lacis lace. The compact pattern repeats horizontally, with inserted bands of two-tailed animals confronting birds. The bird motif is also depicted alongside a flower motif on the outer filet/lacis border."
Utopia,20th Century,Belgium,Drawing,"René Magritte was among the leading figures of the Surrealist movement, whose work emphasized dreams, the subconscious, and a break from reason and logic during the early 20th century. Magritte, in particular, often situated realistic imagery within ridiculous or unusual situations in order to question perception. Here, a rose grows on a rocky island amid a vast sea, set against a blue sky filled with large white clouds. By situating the flower within a barren and inhospitable setting, Magritte invites the viewer to question its purpose and survival. Created as World War II came to an end, the enigmatic image could symbolize a new beginning, although Magritte avoided assigning it a specific meaning."

"Women Worshipping a Shiva Linga: Devagandhari Ragini of Hindol, from a Chamba Ragamala",18th Century,Null,Painting,"Removed from any temple setting, the focus of the scene is on the intensity of the women’s devotions to the Hindu god Shiva in his abstract form of a linga. The figure on the right tosses flower petals on the linga and offers incense in a handheld censer. Her taller companion wearing a yellow blouse holds two lotus flowers in her hands cupped in devotion as she bows reverently."
Standing Buddha,12th Century,Null,Metalwork,"Along with manuscripts, small-scale images of the Buddha could be commissioned by pilgrims or devotees and offered to a monastery in connection with a vow or the consecration of a sacred monument or object. The Buddha stands on a lotus flower that indicates his transcendence above ordinary beings. He is surrounded by flames that communicate his radiance and the intensity of the heat or power he acquired through meditation and discipline. His hands are in the mudra communicating the transmission of the teachings."

Maharana Sangram Singh II (r. 1710–34) Worshipping a Linga Under a Banyan Tree,18th Century,Null,Painting,"The king kneels in worship at an ancient tree shrine on the banks of a lake. Such shrines were often associated with serpent deities, and a four-headed snake painted in gold is wrapped around the linga, the phallic emblem marking the sacred presence of the god Shiva. Flowers, packets of paan (areca nut and sweetmeats wrapped in betel leaf), coconuts, and a flower garland are among the offerings."
A Pair of Decorated Palanquin Hooks and Rings,12th Century,Null,Sculpture,"Hooks, suspension rings, and finials cast in bronze are very common fixtures in Cambodian decorative art. Frequently they served a practical function, such as the present set, used for a palanquin in which a person was carried from place to place. The litter or throne was fastened to the rings which in turn were suspended from the books fixed by bolts to transverse poles carried on the shoulders of the palanquin bearers. Chariots, palanquins, furniture, and harnesses were frequently embellished with various bronze decorations, finials, and fixtures. Those, as a rule, were gilded making the objects they served look very sumptuous. The relief sculpture found on various Khmer monuments, such as Angkor Wat or Bayon for instance, illustrates well the use and context of those bronze implements in ancient Cambodian life. These frequently elaborate bronze fixtures were decorated with motifs generally popular in Cambodian art: such as nagas, garudas, floral, or animal patterns. This pair of hooks and rings, unusually large in size, take on a naga form in the hooks. They are decorated with perforated floral and animal motifs done with great care and precision. The rings, suspended from hooks, are in the form of tri-fold flower stalks with naga motifs repeated at the end of the curved stalks. Such elaborate and huge hooks and rings must have, no doubt, decorated a palanquin of an important individual, possible a ruler himself. Their decoration is typical of the mature Angkor Wat style."
Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara,7th Century,Null,Sculpture,"This rare image survives from the early phase of Buddhist sculpture in Southeast Asia. Made in what is known as the Pra Khon Chai style, it has the characteristic sensitivity of expression, slender physique, and looped locks of hair. This figure once held a lotus flower in the right hand and flask in the left—identifying features of Avalokiteshvara in this region."
"Virgin and Child with St. John, St. Catherine of Siena and Saint Francis",16th Century,Italy,Print,"Printed from four blocks in light blue, green, and black, this chiaroscuro woodcut shows the Virgin and Child flanked by the infant St. John the Baptist and St. Francis at right. St. Catherine of Siena takes a place on the left and holds a flower."
"Portrait of a Woman near a Fountain, a Rose in Her Hand",17th Century,Netherlands,Drawing,"The Dutch artist Johann Thopas made meticulous drawn portraits of merchants and intellectuals in the Dutch city of Assendelft. His drawn portraits—made faster and for less expense than painted portraits—appealed to middle-class patrons, as did his unique style combining naturalistic likenesses with elaborate background settings. Using a combination of leadpoint and ink, Thopas achieved remarkable tonal subtlety in this image of a well-dressed woman holding a flower in front of an ornate neoclassical garden."
Settee,19th Century,England,Wood,"An art collector, designer, and champion of neoclassicism, Thomas Hope designed this settee for display in his London house. Hope’s design exemplifies the continued interest in neoclassical ornament around 1800 through the use of elaborately carved friezes, a central pediment, and a lavishly gilded surface. In 1807 Hope published Household Furniture and Interior Decoration, featuring descriptions of his renowned collection of antiquities and the interior furnishings from his London house, including this settee. Many architects and cabinetmaking firms took inspiration from Hope’s designs, adapting Greek and Roman forms to create bold expressions of neoclassicism in their architecture and decoration."
Flowers and Grasses,19th Century,Japan,Books,"This album contains six small paintings, each of which takes a different plant as its subject. The paintings include depictions of pomegranates, as well as flowering narcissus and orchid."
Basket of Peonies,19th Century,Japan,Print,"A surimono is a privately commissioned print used to announce or commemorate a special event. This picture celebrates an event in the life of the actor Ichikawa Danjuro VII, whose emblem was the peony. According to Japanese tradition, the peony–one of the flowers of the four seasons–is the flower of summer."
Flower Vase with Floral Scroll,19th - 20th Century,Japan,Ceramics,
Inkstand,19th Century,Null,Jewelry,"This enamel inkstand takes the fanciful form of a pleasure boat, linking the composing of poetry and the writing of calligraphy to the amusement of the senses. The luxurious materials and elegant form also indicate that scribal activities require a certain level of refinement. Cleverly, the enamelist placed a lotus design on the bottom of the vessel; as a flower that floats on water, the bloom represents both the water imaginatively splashing against the underside of the boat and the actual ink swishing inside the bilge. This inkstand was purchased by Cleveland Museum of Art founder Jeptha Homer Wade II (1857–1926) and his wife Ellen Garretson Wade (1857–1917) as they made a tour of India on their own pleasure boat, the Wadena."
Famous Views of Ōmi,17th Century,Null,Painting,"Ōmi is an area around Lake Biwa near Kyoto. The Shinto shrine Hiyoshi Taisha and the Buddhist temple Ishiyamadera are in the upper right and upper left of the composition, respectively. At center is the pilgrimage route, and people in the town before the temple gates. Harvested rice fields at right and cherry blossom trees in flower at left show seasonal change from winter to spring."
"Child Standing on a Chair Holding Flowers, with Mother",19th Century,Null,Photograph,"Until the mid-1850s the daguerreotype process was the method preferred by the commercial photographers willing to meet the ever-growing demand for likenesses of family and friends. This daguerreotype captures the patience of a mother and child, who were required to hold their poses for some time during the exposure of the silver-coated copper plate. Only the bouquet of flowers held by the child is slightly blurred. Characteristic of the technique, the details in the image—fabric, facial features, and accessories—are clearly defined."
Sword Guard (Tsuba) with Flower,17th - 19th Century,Null,Arms and Armor,
Water Container with Birds and Flowers,17th Century,Null,Ceramics,"The shape of this small vessel suggests it may be a fresh-water container included among the tools used in Japan for preparing steeped tea, introduced to Japan by Chan (Zen) monks from southern China in the mid-1600s."
Railing Pillar with a Yakshi (Female Nature Divinity),2nd Century,Null,Sculpture,"This pillar would have been an upright of a stair banister, probably leading to an upper circumambulatory path of a Buddhist or Jain sacred monument known as a stupa. It has the image of a nature divinity grasping the branch of an ashoka tree with one hand and touching her breast full of nourishing milk with the other. The reverse side of the pillar is decorated with a stupa at the top and a partially damaged scene set in the architectural framework below."
Maharana Bhim Singh of Mewar (r. 1778–1828) with a Consort,19th Century,India,Painting,"The consort folds her hands in devotion to the Maharana whose glory is highlighted with a halo behind his head. The Maharana fondly holds the chin of his paramour and appears to be in the process of putting a garland around her neck. One of the most celebrated artists in the history of painting at Mewar, Chokha has nestled the couple in an overabundance of bolsters, their chamber covered with pink flower petals and draped with yellow garlands."
"Vasudhara, Goddess of Abundance",14th - 15th Century,Null,Sculpture,"In Nepal this female counterpart of the god of wealth is one of the most popular divinities. This image was set up in either a domestic shrine or a Buddhist monastery, where devotees would pray to her for wealth, prosperity, and children. In each of her six arms she holds objects pertaining to life and abundance: jewels, an overflowing pot, and a sheaf of wheat. A Buddhist philosophical text rests on top of the lotus flower she holds in her topmost left hand, suggesting that wealth and prosperity can derive from the acquisition of true knowledge."
Brahma,19th Century,Null,Painting,"The god of creation has four arms and four heads. The manuscript in his upper right hand indicates that he is the source of sacred knowledge as the quintessential Brahman. The lotus flower in his lower right hand references birth and procreation. He would typically hold a rosary and water pot in his left hands, which are here difficult to clearly identify given the cursory style of Kalighat painitngs. His mount, the goose, examines the ground at his feet."
"Rati, the Goddess of Erotic Love, Takes Aim at Krishna, from a Rasikapriya",17th Century,Null,Painting,"In a brightly lit chamber, the heroine (nayika) confers with her confidante (sakhi), perhaps to convey a message to Krishna, who sits in a grove near a lotus pond at the lower right. In the lower left corner, Rati shoots a flower arrow at Krisha to smite him with love for the nayika. The empty bower in the upper right awaits the lovers’ tryst."

Marie-Yolande de Fitz-James,19th Century,France,Painting,"This portrait depicts Marie-Yolande de Fitz-James, the 12-year-old daughter of Édouard de Fitz-James. Fantin-Latour painted a series of portraits of her family members in preparation for a large group portrait that was never completed. Although Fantin-Latour frequently exhibited with his close friend Édouard Manet and the Impressionists, he remained committed to traditional studio production and never painted outdoors."
Flower Garden of Chateau Rambouillet,Date Unknown,France,Print,
Red Amida,14th Century,Null,Painting,"This rare image depicts the Crimson Crystal Buddha of Infinite Life, or Red Amida, with a red body; it is more common to see Red Amida with a red robe. His crown contains the Five Wisdom Buddhas who represent different aspects of wisdom. He is supported by a lotus flower with five- and single-pronged vajras, ritual implements derived from ancient Indian weapons. Their selection is particular to specific deities and rites and based on sacred texts."
Face Lift No. 3,20th Century,United States,Photograph,"This self-portrait shows the artist recovering from her face lift. It was taken in daylight in a garden, probably her own given the airplane whirligig, which references Noggle’s years as a professional pilot. To her face she holds a flower, a traditional symbol of the fleeting nature of female beauty. This image refutes that idea, suggesting that aging can be fought, but at a price."
Equestrian Portrait of Maharana Raj Singh II of Mewar (r. 1755–62),18th Century,Null,Painting,"The youthful king was only eleven years old when he inherited the throne from his father Pratap Singh II (r. 1752–55). Here shown with barely the beginnings of facial hair starting to grow, he wears a gorgeous turban with fresh flowers tucked into the bejeweled band, and a lion-headed dagger in his belt. Multicolored clouds gather forbiddingly in the sky, promising rain, as the black stallion trots through the grasses, and he gestures to his attendants not to be afraid."
Lamp Stand with Coiling Dragons and Lotus Design,6th - 10th Century,Null,Ceramics,
"Stele of the High Priest of Ptah, Shedsunefertem",10th Century,Null,Sculpture,"This stele of Shedsunefertem, the High Priest of Ptah, is rich in religious symbolism. In the center of the top register is a disk and crescent, originally gilded. At either side a baboon raises its arms in adoration. The Egyptians believed that the jabbering of the baboons at dawn was a hymn of praise to the sun god Ra in a secret language only the king understood. It begins, ""Praising Ra when he shines on the horizon."" Directly below in the middle register a child god is seated on a lotus flower. In Egyptian mythology the sun arose out of the primeval waters at the dawn of creation in a lotus flower. Winged figures of Maat, goddess of Truth, stand protectively at either side. The damaged figure of the high priest himself, wearing the panther skin and jackal-collar of his office, appears at the far right, worshipping the god Ptah, whose consort, the lioness-headed goddess Sekhmet, appears on the far left. The figures in the bottom register are colleagues who appear here as dependents under the powerful high priest's protection."
A night scene of Shiva puja (recto); Calligraphy (verso),18th Century,India,Painting,"Hindu women had been prominent members of Mughal harems since the time of Akbar, whose chief queen was a Hindu princess from the kingdom of Amber (later renamed Jaipur) in present-day Rajasthan. Under golden stars and a crescent moon, this royal palace woman holds a flower garland to offer at a shrine to the Hindu god Shiva. The light of butter lamps casts a shadow behind her figure; experimentation with the depiction of shadows, typically absent in earlier Mughal painting, increased among artists during the 1700s."
Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints Francis and Giovanni Gualberto,16th Century,Italy,Sculpture,"The Madonna sits upon a throne with the Christ child standing on her knee. He is steadied by his mother, turning delicately to grasp her robe for support. On the left is Saint Francis, identified by his stigmata. On the right, Saint Giovanni Gualberto is identified by his monk's robe and distinctive processional cross. The brown robes of the saints, the purple of the Virgin's tunic (a shade characteristic of the artist), and the flesh tones of the figures contrast strongly against the bright blue background. In the semicircular sky behind the figures, three winged cherub heads emerge, representing a host of angels. Glazed terracotta is both durable and decorative and the gleaming white of this piece would have stood out in the darkness of a church. The medium was made popular by Renaissance artist Luca della Robbia and came into fashion as a substitute for expensive carved marble. A rounded arch frame embellished with fruit and flower garlands as well as egg-and-dart and cord moldings accompanied the work when it was acquired, but was later determined not to be original and removed. Buglioni's work bears the influence of the della Robbias, particularly in the simple color scheme. Buglioni likely worked in the studio of Luca's nephew, Andrea, where he would have learned the technique of glazing terracotta."
A Hundred Birds and the Three Friends,15th Century,China,Painting,"In this hanging scroll birds rest and frolic among pines, bamboo, and flowering plum, plants known as “the three friends.” Due to their endurance in winter, they symbolize perseverance and friendship in adverse times. The naturalistic depiction of the birds refers to the bird-and-flower painting tradition of the Art Academy of the Song dynasty. The painter Bian Wenjin served at the court of the Ming dynasty Yongle Emperor (reigned 1402–24). This painting may have been hung in a private studio or palace hall on appropriate occasions."
A Collection of Flowers Drawn from Nature:  Large Double China Aster,18th Century,England,Print,Edwards was one of the best botanical draftsmen of the 18th century. Large Double China Aster is from a superb and extremely rare book with 77 plates illustrating a variety of beautiful flowers. The coloring is particularly fine owing to the use of pale printer’s ink that does not interfere with the delicacy of the watercolor.
Basket of Eggs with Envelope,20th Century,United States,Drawing,"This is one of 44 postcard collages in the CMA’s collection that the textile artist Lenore Tawney sent through the mail to her friend, the art dealer, curator, and critic Katherine Kuh between 1969 and 1981. Using natural objects and ephemera that she compiled over a lifetime, Tawney’s collages display the artist’s personal visual vocabulary and poetic response to materials. Recurring images—such as eggs, feathers, birds, baby animals, crosses, and circles—engage with universal themes such as vulnerability, resilience, infinity, and spirituality. Here, below the flower petal on the envelope Tawney wrote ""the iris / its blue blood drained away."""
Flower Gardens of Seaux,18th Century,France,Print,
"""Phoenix Tail"" Vase (龍泉窯青釉瓶)",14th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Monumental celadon vases were used for flower arrangements, often in pairs in temples or larger households. Most of them, like this example, have survived in Japan. The vase’s glaze is of exceptional color and consistency. By the Yuan dynasty, Longquan potters mastered techniques to fire vases, jars, and plates of enormous sizes and in great quantities. Some 300 kilns were active in the Longquan area, in Zhejiang province, to supply the domestic and export markets, such as Japan, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and North Africa. Celadons reached Europe as early as the 1400s."
Lilac,19th Century,Germany,Print,"Lilac belongs to a series of cut-out silhouettes created by Philipp Otto Runge around the early 1800s. Each presents a plant or flower in exacting detail, including each petal and leaf. The technique used was a traditional folk practice, which Runge learned early on from his mother. He ultimately produced well over one hundred such works, which he occasionally gave as gifts; this work, for example, was offered by the artist to the Specktors, a Hamburg based family of artists."
Hanaōgi of Ōgiya from the series Picture Puzzles,18th Century,Japan,Print,"In this tricky print, one must decode the small pictures in the rectangle at the upper left corner to learn the identity of the subject of the print: a woman whose name means ""Flower Fan,"" her place of work called the ""House of Fans,"" and what she is doing—emerging from a mosquito net."

The ceramics painter of this work depicted Zhou seemingly appreciating both the lotus and the young lady with a lotus in the boat."
Veneration of the Buddha as a Fiery Pillar,2nd - 3rd Century,Null,Sculpture,"Lively, attenuated figures of celestial beings or nature divinities (yakshas) dance and praise the fiery pillar, which stands in for the presence of the Buddha. The top portion of the pillar surrounded by flames is at the bottom of this fragment, and it is topped with a motif that combines a lotus flower with a trident-shaped symbol often used to mark a sacred and auspicious presence."
Bowl with Birds and Flowers,17th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This porcelain bowl is considered to have been made in the ""Transitional period,"" a term used to define the period between about 1620 and 1683 when official kilns in Jingdezhen were no longer under imperial supervision due to the transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasties."
"The Parrot Addresses Khujasta at the Beginning of the Twenty-sixth Night, from a Tuti-nama (Tales of a Parrot)",16th Century,Null,Painting,"When the sun, like a saffron-hued frog, plunged into the pond in the west and the moon, like a fish, came out of its snare in the east, Khujasta adorned with many kinds of jewels and bedecked with a variety of gold and silver ornaments went to Tuti to ask permission to leave.The parrot’s cage seems to hover in midair in the porch of a domed pavilion. The flowering treeentwining the cypress alludes to Khujasta’s desire to embrace her lover. As waterfowl course through the air, the parrot begins his story about the frog king Shapur."
"Page from the Late Shah Jahan Album: Persian Calligraphy framed by an ornamental border of flowers, birds, and deer",16th Century,India,Painting,"About 100 years after the calligraphy was completed by a Persian master and embellished with gold and floral arabesques, the small page was mounted into an album for the Mughal emperor of India. Mughal artists filled the outer border with floral vines, blooming and budding with many varieties. Pairs of birds perch throughout; male and female deer relax, listening to the birdsong. The Indian artists chose to emphasize nature’s abundance and life-giving forces, whereas the Persian artists sought to achieve exquisite, gemlike refinement.The central poem, by Ibn-i Yamin (Persian, 1286–1368), encourages the reader not to worry about unexpected calamities."

The sakura blossoms are delicately depicted in an iron-red overglaze. The flowers’ various positions (facing out and downward) and stages of maturity (bud and full bloom) enhance the naturalism and dynamism of the image.

"Collection of Flowers and Fruits Painted after Nature:  Bouquet of Foxglove, Clematis, Pansy, Peony, Poppy, and Yellow Day Lily",19th Century,France,Print,"By the mid-17th century, there was a surge of interest in beautiful, exotic plants and formal royal gardens. At Fountainebleau and the Louvre, the gardens were filled with flowers from far-away places, such as the Near East, India, the East and West Indies, and South America. In 1735 Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) invented the first scientific classification system for 7,700 plants. As a result, accuracy as well as artistic skill were required for the numerous portfolios of botanical prints popular with gardeners and those involved with the decorative arts. In these lavish productions, some of the color is printed but the remainder is added with watercolor, giving the illusion of transparency, luminosity, and the delicacy characteristic of flowers. Stipple was a technique developed in England from the 1760s. A point is used to build up a mass of flicks and dots to create a wide range of tones."
Vase with Floral Scrolls,17th Century,Null,Enamel,"In cloisonné enameling, the decorative patterns are outlined by soldering metal wires (usually copper) to a metal base, creating a network of cells, or cloisons, to be filled with powdered enamels. Here. a turquoise ground separates the stylized chrysanthemum flower and leaf pattern, which winds around the neck and body. After firing, the enamels are polished to create a smooth surface level with the cloisons. The exposed metal surfaces are gilt."
Shakyamuni Triad: Buddha Attended by Manjushri and Samantabhadra (Bodhisattva with Elephant),14th Century,Null,Painting,"This triptych is a rare example of Yuan Buddhist painting. It depicts the historic Buddha Shakyamuni flanked by two attending bodhisattvas, Manjushri (the bodhisattva of wisdom, riding a lion) and Samantabhadra (the bodhisattva of universal virtue, riding an elephant). Below them are others seeking enlightenment: two disciples of the Buddha (Ananada and Kasyapa), two non-Chinese people, a boy with topknots, and a female worshiper. The clouds above and around the divine beings form one scene that illustrates Shakyamuni’s sermon from the Lotus Sutra. This text became an important basis for Buddhist faith throughout East Asia and was central to the Mahayana school of Buddhism."
Roundel with Mermaids and Lotus,2nd Century BCE,Null,Ivories,"This ivory disk was possibly part of a massive earring around which lobes were stretched so that they rest on the shoulders. Eight figures that are half woman and half fish hold hands in a ring around a series of concentric circles containing floral imagery. Their hands and tails make the repeated form of an auspicious trident-shaped symbol, often depicted with fish tails in combination with a lotus flower. The full-breasted forms, the tails, and the lotus flowers evoke the imagery of life-giving waters. A circle of eight female figures later comes to refer to the maidens of the eight directions of the sky (ashtadikpalikas)."
Pomona Britannica: No. 72 - Amicua (Melon),19th Century,England,Print,"This color aquatint etching is one plate from George Brookshaw’s 1812 illustrated volume Pomona Britannica. Named after the Roman goddess of fruit trees, gardens, and orchards, Brookshaw intended the volume to be the English “country gentleman’s” guide to the science of classifying and identifying fruits (pomology). Many of Brookshaw’s models came from the Royal Gardens at Hampton Court and Kensington Gardens. Each print featured one fruit, often life-size, including detailed depictions of its flower and leaves. Printed in color with hand-painted highlights, this and other illustrated botanicals formed an essential part of the cultured English library in the early 19th century."

Her broad hips and simple, elegant garments and jewelry barely interrupt the contours of her form. Her lowered right hand, in the gift-giving gesture, holds a fruit, and her left hand once held the stem of a flower."
Hookah Base,18th Century,Null,Glass,"Smoking tobacco was introduced to the Mughal court from Iran in the very early 1600s and soon became popular. This base formed part of a hookah, or water pipe, which consisted of a base that held water—sometimes perfumed with herbs or fresh fruit—a detachable bowl to hold tobacco, and a long tube. Early hookahs used existing vessels for bases, including coconut shells. By the late 1600s or early 1700s, richly decorated pieces like this were produced. The jewel-like decoration of blue and green blossoms evokes a garden in which a smoker might have sat."

Elites of the Goryeo period commissioned a variety of types of utensils and vessels including this elegant bottle, not only to make their drinking experience more exciting, but also to show their appreciation of nature. During the Goryeo period (918-1392), kilns operated in Jeolla and Chungcheong provinces, meeting a soaring demand for high-quality tableware."
Quatrelobed Dish from Dessert Service: Nettle-leaved Bell Flower,19th Century,England,Ceramics,
Covered Jar with Carved Lotus Petals,4th - 6th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This jar still has its original cover, which is rare among surviving examples. Its missing knob most likely had the shape of a lotus bud. Beautifully carved lotus petals cover the vessel’s shoulder and lid under a translucent green glaze. In Buddhism, the lotus is a flower symbolizing purity and detachment from worldly affairs; its presence suggests that this vessel was meant to be used in a religious context. The well-crafted double loop handles may have held a silk cloth or other textile that would have been folded over the lid to keep it in place. This aesthetic prefigures the celebrated green celadons in adjacent regions."
"Portrait of Sardar Singh (Son of Savant Singh, 1730–68)",18th Century,Null,Painting,"The ruler of the princely state of Kishangarh chose to have himself depicted in an intoxicatingly paradisiacal setting. He and his queen occupy jeweled chairs on a white marble terrace with formal flower gardens overlooking a lake. They listen to a musical performance while female attendants stand ready to whisk away flies and serve tiny bottles liquor. The fresh palette and dramatically elongated eyes, especially on the women, are hallmarks of the most celebrated works from this Rajput court. The king is portrayed with less exaggerated features than the women, which makes him seem more human, despite the halo that sets off his face and elaborate turban."
Vaslav Nijinsky in Le Spectre de la Rose,20th Century,France,Photograph,"The Phantom of the Rose tells the story of a young woman who returns from her first ball with a souvenir rose. She dreams that the flower becomes a phantom who dances with her, the role played by Vaslav Nijinsky. This ballet became one of the most beloved productions of the Ballets Russes, which toured Europe and North and South America between 1909 and 1929."
Female Figure of a Court Entertainer Dancing,2nd Century,Null,Ceramics,"During the Han era, tombs of the elite were provided with sculpted renditions of their earthly entourage, such as guardians or musicians, to signify their status in the afterlife. The female dancer with elaborate hairdo held by flower ornaments raises one arm holding her wide sleeve with one hand, while the other lifts her robe to reveal what appears to be a drum underneath her garment, her face smiling, all in a gesture of an entertainer."
Nō Costume (Nuihaku) with  Blossoming Trees and Flowers,17th Century,Null,Garment,"This magnificent robe was a costume specifically designed for performances of Noh theater in Japan. Originating during the 1300s from simple folk plays, Noh drama evolved into formal presentations of ritual, theater, dance, and music performed in the courts and shrines of the nobility. Stories were derived from a variety of sources—myths, legends, poetry, and prose—many dating back to the medieval period. Because great importance was placed on subtlety and elegance, plots tended to be minimal. Whether male or female all roles were played by men. Central to these performances were the masks and costumes worn by the actors. The brilliance and elegance of this robe are characteristic of costumes made solely for Noh theater. Its date in the first half of the 1700s is indicated by the proportions of the robe, the choice of embroidery stitches (satin, couching, and outline), and the absence of decoration at the hips, a fashion also reflected in kimonos at that time. The design of weeping cherry trees and irises in the snow was very likely inspired by a medieval Japanese poem. Robes decorated with embroidery against a gold ground were reserved for female roles. These robes were worn under the external garment and were only partially visible."
Padmapani Lokeshvara Seated on the Rock,8th Century,Null,Sculpture,"Though diminutive, this image conveys a monumental power through the intense expression particular to Kashmiri art. He sits alert in yogic concentration on a lotus pedestal that exists miraculously in a rocky wilderness. His left hand holds the stem of a lotus flower—the main attribute of this bodhisattva of compassion. His generously sized right hand with fleshy palm is in the gift-giving gesture. The tiny figure of Amitabha, the Buddha who sits in meditation in his crown, identifies the image as Avalokiteshvara."
Violette Heymann,20th Century,France,Drawing,"Although he was known early in his career for works primarily in black and white, such as charcoal drawings and lithographs, Odilon Redon turned to more colorful media, including pastel, later on. In particular, he focused on commissioned pastel portraits of women with flowers, such as this one. Here, the young niece of the Parisian collector Marcel Kapferer appears alongside colorful blossoms as she looks forward, focused as if in the dreamlike state evoked by her surroundings."
Pomona Britannica: No. 33 - Peaches,19th Century,England,Print,"This color aquatint etching is one plate from George Brookshaw’s 1812 illustrated volume Pomona Britannica. Named after the Roman goddess of fruit trees, gardens, and orchards, Brookshaw intended the volume to be the English “country gentleman’s” guide to the science of classifying and identifying fruits (pomology). Many of Brookshaw’s models came from the Royal Gardens at Hampton Court and Kensington Gardens. Each print featured one fruit, often life-size, including detailed depictions of its flower and leaves. Printed in color with hand-painted highlights, this and other illustrated botanicals formed an essential part of the cultured English library in the early 19th century."

Scenes from the Life of Buddha,2nd Century,Null,Sculpture,"In this compact narrative relief, which was made to adorn a Buddhist stupa, scenes from the early life of the Buddha are depicted in order from top to bottom. His birth is at the top. The infant, now broken, is being received by Indra, King of the Gods, from the right side of his mother, who is depicted like a tree deity, grasping a branch with one hand. The baby Buddha miraculously took seven steps immediately after he was born, as indicated by the standing diminutive figure at the left of the scene. The next scene depicts the bodhisattva Maitreya, who will be the next Buddha to be born in the future, as an element of foreshadowing. Returning to the life of the historical Buddha, the sculptors then depict him as a prince, enjoying palace life with his wife. Eventually, he is compelled to leave his family to seek enlightenment and try to end the suffering in the world. In the lowest panel he rides off to the forest with a carved halo behind his head. In the border areas are meditating Buddha images, worshippers, guardians, and earth deities who drag a massive flower garland adorning the panel."
Lotus No. 12,20th Century,China,Print,"Chen Qi's works often show a single object up close. Here an open lotus flower set against a black ink ground evokes the image of a blossom merged into and reflecting the bright moonlight. At close view, the bulging petals defined by crisp printed lines show fine veins in relief, embossed into the paper and achieved through a blind impressed wooden block that has no ink.Chen Qi has been awarded many prizes for his art on a national and international level, including a gold medal at the 13th National Print Exhibition in 1996 in Beijing. He has exhibited in Europe and Asia, including Paris, Geneva, Kuala Lumpur, and New Delhi."
Bouquet,17th Century,France,Print,"Seventeenth-century botanical illustrators were stimulated by a surge of interest in their subject. While in the mid-16th century only 500 plants were known, less than a century later that number had grown to 6,000. A passion for cultivating beautiful rather than useful plants took hold, and formal gardens with carefully arranged flower beds based on embroidery designs supplemented varieties of local plants with foreign samples. Exotic flowers became available in Europe as the Dutch founded colonies in the East and West Indies, South America, and India. While fabulous royal gardens were planted in France at Fontainebleau and the Louvre, for instance, in England “a whole nation went mad about flowers.”"
Fatima,20th Century,Austria,Textile,"Inspired by English cotton chintz patterns, Josef Frank created several designs for cotton textiles used as clothing. Fatima was likely meant for summer evening gowns due to the cotton’s light weight. The design’s vibrant floral motifs in intricate arrangements would have made a fresh and fashionable impression without overemphasizing the pattern’s geometry."

Millefiori Bowl,1st Century,Null,Glass,"Mosaic glass, also called millefiori, was cast in a two-part mold. Fused glass rods of different colors were bundled together into patterns, then sliced into disk-shaped cross sections. These were placed within the mold and heated until fused. After cooling, the vessel’s surface was fire- or wheel-polished."

"Krishna sporting with the gopis in the Jumna River, from a Bhagavata Purana",16th Century,Null,Painting,"This page is from one of the earliest surviving illustrated Hindu manuscripts from India. It belongs to an extensive series on the life of Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu. Shown here in blue, frolicking energetically with a bevy of young women from the cowherder village where he lived as a youth, Krishna is in the middle of the composition and the center of attention. Celestial musicians offer flower garlands and beat percussion instruments in the skies to accompany their passionate play. Lively gestures and bold patterning of the water lend to the exuberance of the scene."

Yellow Chrysanthemums and Red Osmanthus in the Style of Wang Yuan,15th Century,China,Painting,"Shen Zhou, a native from Suzhou, was descended from a prominent land-owning family with strong ties to literati culture. Because Shen Zhou never entered government service, he had ample opportunity to cultivate the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy.Chrysanthemums and red osmanthus both bloom in autumn. The deep orange osmanthus flowers emanate a characteristically sweet fragrance. According to his inscription on the painting, Shen Zhou sought to imitate the style of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) painter Wang Yuan. His color-filled brushstrokes and washes, however, anticipate the flower painting style of Yun Shouping, whose Peonies are also in the Cleveland Museum of Art collection, https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1967.192. The sheer size and complex composition of this scroll are impressive."
"Four-armed goddess, with hearts in margin",20th Century,Null,Painting,"This goddess holds a lotus flower and a discus, along with two other unidentified objects. Historically, Madhubani paintings were murals created with brushes made of bamboo and cotton. They ornamented domestic spaces on the occasion of a festival or rite of passage in a woman's life, such as a birth or a wedding. In the wake of a drought in 1966, the All India Handicrafts Board encouraged women of the Mithila region make paintings on paper, so they could sell them and help support their communities."
"The Lovelorn Heroine, from a Sat Sai of Bihari",18th Century,Null,Painting,"The Sat Sai is a collection of poems mainly describing the beauty of women in a range of emotional states. The heroine of this poem sits against a tree that is in full flower, like her, but her lover is absent, and other girls walk by, gossiping. Not coincidentally, her dress matches the color of the blossoms, and no bees come to pollinate."
Untitled (Farm Animals),19th Century,France,Photograph,"This charming view of village life by Braun is one of only about five known large-scale prints produced from a small number of negatives. It represents one of the earliest studies of animals not portrayed by a daguerreotype. This complex and densely filled composition is beautifully balanced and enhanced by the skillful use of natural light in order to highlight the animals. The abundant clarity of detail suggests that Braun intended to market these photographs to visual artists as models for their compositions, just as he did with flower studies accomplished around the same time."
Youth as a Stand-in Monju,18th Century,Japan,Print,"In this image, a handsome young man replaces the Buddhist figure Monju, a bodhisattva—or enlightened being—often shown riding a lion. Monju symbolizes wisdom and customarily holds a sword and a sacred text atop a lotus flower. The youth here meditates instead on his tobacco kit and a long pipe. The print was once paired with another, showing a young woman replacing Fugen, a bodhisattva who rides an elephant."
Étude de fleurs d'après nature:  Spray of Flowers,Date Unknown,France,Print,"Crayon manner etching was invented in the 18th century to simulate the texture of chalk drawings, which were very popular at the time. A tool with toothed points of varying thicknesses set at irregular intervals and angles (mattoir) imitated the random character of grains of chalk on textured paper. Etudes de fleurs d’après nature demonstrates how prints propagated floral designs that could be used in the applied arts. Artisans designing textiles or decorating furniture, for instance, were inspired by the compositions found on prints."

"Vase with Inlaid Lotus, Plum, and Bamboo Design",14th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Flattened-shaped jars like this one started to appear around the late 13th century. Each of the flattened sides is decorated with an image of a lotus flower pond, enclosed in a lobed panel. The protruding sides, on the other hand, depict an image of bamboo trees and plum blossoms. This particular example seems to have been produced in the late 14th century, when the overall quality of techniques involved in making celadon works sharply deteriorated. In contrast to translucent greenish blue celadon works of the 12th century, this flask has gray greenish glaze due to less refined clay. Furthermore, its rather roughly executed inlaid design shows a clear sign of decline in craftsmanship. Nevertheless, less attention to technical details gave way to a freer style pottery called buncheong in the succeeding centuries."
Round Box with Bird and Peonies Design,14th Century,Null,Lacquer,"The carved lacquer box and lobed silver container nearby both feature pairs of birds and flowers on their covers. There is a striking similarity in decoration, shape, and aesthetic appeal. Both boxes suggest that successful designs and shapes circulated among craftsmen, workshops, and beyond regional borders."
Hevajra,13th Century,Null,Sculpture,"Hevajra was an important figure signaling the practice of Buddhist rituals. King Jayavarman VII placed particular emphasis on Hevajra during consecration rituals and set up a colossal stone sculpture of dancing Hevajra at the east gate of his fortified city in the Khmer capital at Angkor. In the Cambodia of Jayavarman VII, tantric Buddhism became public and widespread, practiced together with other more mainstream forms of Buddhism, Hinduism, and ancestor worship. The iconography of Hevajra is described in detail in a text that bears his name, the Hevajra-tantra, first composed in India probably in the 800s. Hevajra has eight heads, sixteen arms, and four legs. His left hands hold images of Indic gods; wealth, death, sun, moon, fire, wind, water, and earth. In his right hands are animals: bull, lion, human, cat, camel, sheep, horse, and elephant. They all sit in skull cups, objects also used in tantric rituals. He dances on a corpse that embodies ignorance and is surrounded by eight yoginis who dance triumphantly in a ring around him. Yoginis functioned as intercessors between human practitioners and enlightened beings. Many bronze images of Hevajra were made during the reign of Jayavarman VII, but few survive in as pristine condition as this example. According to scientific analysis and curatorial reports, this sculpture survived in a clay vessel submerged in water, which accounts for its high tin content and unusual gray patina. Samples from the clay core reveal the presence of the mineral feldspar, a characteristic of clay from the Isaan plateau, on the other side of the mountain range not far from Banteay Chhmar, in present-day Thailand."
Section from a Portable Shrine,2nd Century,Null,Sculpture,"Figures of deities who protect children are featured in this relief carving. A form of Skanda holding a bird and a flower stands next to a regal yakshi with pointed rodent or elephant ears. A diminutive figure who may be a child is shown kneeling at his feet. Above, the six-headed mother goddess Shashthi sits next to Skanda, holding the spear."
"The parrot addresses Khujasta at the beginning of the forty-first night, from a Tuti-nama (Tales of a Parrot): Forty-first Night",16th Century,Null,Painting,"On the forty-first of fifty-two nights, Khujasta consults Tuti the parrot for advice on how to balance her lover’s wishes with her vow of marriage. Tuti, perched atop his cage, responds by telling her a story about a donkey who was punished for singing too brazenly."

"Hatsuito of the Yamashiroya Likened to Bush Clover, from Beauties of the Floating World Compared to Flowers",18th Century,Japan,Print,"Courtesan Hatsuito of a brothel named Yamashiroya is likened to autumnal bush clover in this series comparing the qualities of courtesans to flowers. Hatsuito ties her servant’s obi sash while a gibbon emerges from a painting in the room’s viewing alcove to offer a love letter on which Hatsuito’s name appears. Gibbons reaching in vain for the moon’s reflection in water is a common metaphor for the deluded mind, and bush clover in moonlight is a popular seasonal motif. Here, the ideas are combined as the gibbon woos this unattainable beauty."
Armchair,19th Century,United States,Furniture,"Louis Comfort Tiffany began his artistic career as a painter, having studied with George Innes and Samuel Colman in America as well as with various artists in Paris. While he achieved some early success with his orientalist works, his interests were soon drawn to interior furnishings and design. He collaborated with other artisans to form Associated Artists in 1879 and began work on major commissions such as the Mark Twain House (1881) and the White House for President Chester Arthur (1882). He debuted designs for furniture at the 1893 Chicago world's fair, and this armchair is believed to have been among those pieces. Even after he achieved enormous success with his glass production, Tiffany continued to produce interior furnishings and design schemes for artistic interiors throughout the rest of his career."
Border Strips of a Skirt,17th - 18th Century,Null,Embroidery,"The primary motif is a large stylized flowering vase with fantastic flowers and foliage, two small figures sitting among the foliage, two birds at the top eating flowers and, in the center, a double-headed eagle. Two of these motifs appear on the large strip, separated by a much smaller flowering vase with two goat-like animals at the base. At the top and bottom is a border of arched compartments containing, alternately, a flower and a two-tailed mermaid or a double-headed eagle."
A feast in a pavilion setting,17th Century,India,Painting,"Two gentlemen sit on a low carpeted platform in a walled garden. They wear bulbous turbans meant to indicate a historical time or distant place other than Mughal India. Behind them is the entry of a wealthy family’s house with one of the double doors open, leading to the inner quarters and a covered pavilion on the rooftop. The vestibule’s rear wall is ornamented with niches and wall paintings. Emperor Jahangir admired Persian art and culture, employing Persian painters such as Muhammad Ali in his royal atelier. He enjoyed gatherings such as this, with books and music, wine and fruits."

Leaf from a Book of Hours: Initial D,15th Century,Null,Manuscript,"Not all books of hours were decorated with conventional historiated initials or full-page miniatures containing figural scenes. The illuminator of this leaf incorporated a more subtle decorative scheme consisting of a large, flower-filled initial D for Deus that gives a focus to the page. A rectangular bar border with ivy leaf sprays punctuated with flowers in the corners flows from this initial. The layout is neat, yet elegant. The palette of orange-reds and pale blues is typically English."
"Lotuses, Insects, and Birds",19th Century,Null,Painting,"Pairs of herons, kingfishers, and dragonflies punctuate a profusion of lotus in this composition that, given the orientation of the herons and the clustering of motifs in the left-hand side of the work, may have once been the left painting of a pair. Given its subject matter, this hanging scroll may have been hung for display during the summer."

Portrait of a Woman with Flowers,20th Century,United States,Photograph,"For more than 50 years, James VanDerZee produced images that embody the spirit of Harlem. From the 1920s to the 1940s, he was the neighborhood's most popular and prolific photographer, his camera capturing everyone from ordinary citizens to celebrities. In the studio VanDerZee photographed glamorously dressed young people and dignified men and women. On location, he chronicled picnics, parades, families, church congregations, and the dead in their coffins. These four prints, from a collection of 33 recently acquired by the museum, show VanDerZee's skill at posing and lighting his subjects. His artistic sensibilities are reflected in elaborate backdrops and the use of accessories that reinforced his sitters' associations with culture and wealth. The artist worked with a variety of techniques, including multiple negatives and hand coloring, to make artful photographs that set him apart from his more traditional, less aesthetically inclined competitors. Just as he often signed his name and date directly onto the negative, he would also selectively draw on it-to smooth a complexion and touch up imperfections, or to add extra jewelry or smoke drifting from a cigarette-whatever was necessary to emphasize the grace and dignity of his client, regardless of race, age, or social status."

Incense Burner with Lotus Petal Design in Relief,12th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Celadons wares used for everyday such as this incense burner were among the most common burial objects in tombs during the Goryeo period (918–1392). Furnishing tombs with an elaborate assemblage of objects was believed to honor and comfort the newly dead. Generally, Goryeo tombs were left untouched until the late 19th century. During the colonial period (1910–45), however, Japanese archaeologists competitively excavated the tombs located in Kaeseong, the former capital of the Goryeo period, and these wares soon became available for Japanese and Western collectors."
Figures Depicting the Four Seasons,18th Century,England,Ceramics,"In this group depicting the four seasons, a young boy in ice skates represents winter; a young lady adorns her hair with flowers in spring; a young man guards his beehive in summer; and a girl gathers fruit in autumn."
Shalabhanjika (Woman and Tree),4th - 5th Century,Null,Sculpture,"The full carving of a flowering tree on the back of this figurine indicates that she is a figure of a nature divinity who personifies the life-giving qualities of the sap that envigorates the tree and causes it to flower. These figures are sometimes called shalabhanjika, ""she who breaks the tree,"" probably because her fertile properties are so powerful that it causes the tree to fruit so heavily that the branches break."
Stand-in Fugen,18th - 19th Century,Japan,Painting,"Here, a woman dressed as a man replaces Fugen, a bodhisattva—a being among those considered enlightened in Buddhism—who symbolizes learning as a path to awakening and typically rides an elephant. The painting teaches the lesson of impermanence through the petals falling from the lotus flower the woman holds. It also alludes to the legend of Eguchi, a 12th-century courtesan who, following an encounter with a Buddhist monk-poet called Saigyō, revealed herself to be a manifestation of Fugen."
Water-Moon Kannon (Suigetsu Kannon),19th - 20th Century,Null,Painting,"Kannon represents a primary figure of benevolence and compassion in the Buddhist pantheon. Identified early in Buddhist texts as a close attendant to the Buddha, by the 700s Kannon's popularity soared to such an extent in China, Korea, and Japan that the bodhisattva was often worshipped independently. Here at the lower left, Kannon is depicted with the child Zenzai Dōji (Sakskrit: Sudhana), a wealthy boy who, according to the final chapter of the Flower Garland Sutra, visited Kannon's abode Fudaraka (Sanskrit: Potalaka) during a long journey to learn the bodhisattva path."
Figure of a Gardener,18th Century,England,Ceramics,"Even though this figure and her counterpart (1945.37) are not accompanied by a sheep, these ceramic sculptures were sometimes known as “Garland Shepherds” during the mid-1700s. The name derived from a similar set produced by one of the Bow Porcelain Factory’s rivals, the Derby Porcelain Factory, in which the male figure holds a lamb. While these two factories often produced similar sets of pastoral, allegorical, biographical, and religious figures, the Bow Factory was known as one of the preeminent porcelain manufacturers, rivaled only by the Chelsea Porcelain Factory, with which Bow would later merge."
Flora [II],20th Century,Austria,Textile,"Also affectionately called Pepi’s Flora after Josef Frank’s childhood nickname “Pepi,” this design depicts imaginary wildflowers concocted by Frank. The whimsically placed yet tightly packed flowers are meant to evoke flowers in the background as well as the borders of French tapestries."
In Praise of Verse: Autumnal Equinox Buddist Service: Manjusaka Flowers,20th Century,Japan,Print,"An ardent Zen Buddhist, Munakata frequently portrayed Buddhist themes in his prints. His style was inspired in part by the direct and simple imagery of popular medieval Buddhist prints and 18th-century Japanese folk paintings."
Icon of the Virgin and Child,6th Century,Null,Textile,"This tapestry glorifying the Virgin Mary is among the rarest objects in the museum’s collection. In a composition borrowed from imperial Byzantine art, Mary is shown seated on a jeweled throne with the Christ child and flanked by archangels Michael and Gabriel. Above, Christ appears in a radiant light supported by two angels. Portraits of the apostles, identified in Greek, appear in the surrounding wreath symbolizing eternal life. This portable sacred textile was presumably displayed at the front of a public or private place of worship. This unique tapestry is one of the earliest Christian icons to survive. Woven icons were among the miraculous works shown to pilgrims in Jerusalem according to Abbot Adomnan of Iona (about 624–704) who described a linen cloth ""said to have been woven by Saint Mary, and is for this reason preserved in a church and venerated by the whole population. Pictures of the twelve apostles are woven into it, and there is also a portrait of the Lord."" The abbot’s description of the woven icon suggests it must have been similar to the tapestry displayed here. The delicate effects of shading in the facial features, garments, and vegetation were achieved by weaving the panel sideways with at least 20 colors, just as medieval tapestry weavers did centuries later in Europe. The high cost of dyes caused this majestic icon to be far costlier than painted images."
Seated Buddha,12th Century,Null,Lacquer,"This rare image of the historical Buddha Shakyamuni is shown seated with crossed legs in the position of meditation. His left hand rests on his lap, referring to his meditation under the Bodhi tree, and his right hand is in the earth-touching gesture—calling the earth to witness his enlightenment. The Buddha sits on a double lotus pedestal that indicates the presence of a transcendent being. The sculptural style is typical of sculptures made at the Buddhist site of Pagan. Sculptures such as this were installed in niches in an interior passage of a temple. As is typical of Burmese works, this sculpture was carved from a solid piece of wood. Its surface was covered in black lacquer and then gilded; a great deal of the gilding remains intact. Because lacquer is an easily perishable material, works of this type and size are exceedingly rare; this sculpture is one of the best extant examples."
Maharana Jagat Singh Attending the Raslila,18th Century,India,Painting,"To celebrate the New Year festival of Diwali, dancers reenact the life story of the Hindu god Krishna in a palace courtyard by candlelight under the full moon. The king, a vassal of the Mughal emperor, sits with the halo of divine sanction for his rule at the left of the courtyard, smoking from a golden goat-shaped hookah, with his young son and heir at his side. At the top of the composition, a dancer dressed in blue with a peacock-feather crown plays the part of Krishna. In the upper right corner, a canopy painted with swirling storm clouds stands for the rainstorm sent by the jealous king of the gods, who is shown in the middle of the canopy with his consort and mount, the elephant with seven trunks. Guards and grooms in the foreground entertain themselves with music while they wait with the horses of visiting nobles. The formal geometric gardens, playful use of perspective, and individualized portraiture indicate the selective adoption of the styles and sensibilities of the imperial Mughal court in the paintings from this large-format series."
Octafoil Mirror with Two Immortals Crossing the Ocean,10th – 13th Century,Null,Metalwork,"This mirror in the shape of a flower represents two immortals crossing the ocean, surrounded by surging waves. The younger figure on the left wears two buns on his head; the elder one with a long beard is carrying a musical instrument, sheng. The scene may illustrate “The Eight Immortals Crossing the Ocean,” in which their supernatural power to walk on water is depicted. The two men here stand on their swords to travel on water. In Daoist and Buddhist thinking, swords are considered powerful, magical implements to exorcise demons and destroy evil spirits."
Black and White Lilies III,20th Century,United States,Photograph,"In the early 1920s, Cunningham combined the clarity and directness of modernism with her long-held interest in botanical imagery. For two decades she created a remarkable group of close-up studies of plants and flowers that identified her as one of the most sophisticated and experimental photographers working in America. In this dramatic, tightly cropped composition, Cunningham isolated two lilies against a simple velvet backdrop. A black calla (arum palaestium) was rhythmically placed in front of a white calla (zantedeschia aethiopica). The expanded scale of the black flower, with its partially visible spadix diagonally positioned, dominates the picture. The sculptural shapes and rich textures were emphasized by the combination of daylight and blue tungsten photofloods and the copious detail provided by the 8x10-inch negative. This sensuous print also encompasses a luxurious range of tones, from velvety black to milky white."
Plate from Dessert Service: Chinese Ixia,19th Century,England,Ceramics,"Each dish is decorated with recognizable plants, the names of which are inscribed on the base in both Latin and English. Identifying the blossoms only became customary in the late 18th century when a single piece of porcelain was decorated with one species, and flowers were represented along with leaves, stems, seed pods, and roots. All of this reflects Carolus Linnaeus’s recent invention of a scientific method to categorize all known flora. The decorations on the Derby factory’s products derive from contemporary English botanical publications. For instance, illustrations in William Curtis’s The Botanical Magazine served as models for the French marigold and nettle leaved bell flower on the dessert service."

Dish,17th Century,England,Silver,"Silver fulfilled a prominent role in projecting wealth, status, power, and ritual in British life during the 1600s and 1700s. Elaborate forms such this shallow dish not only represented wealth in its sheer silver weight but also provided royal and aristocratic owners a surface for displaying engraved coats of arms. For example, this dish is engraved with the arms of Sir Charles Holte (1648–1722), the 3rd Baronet of Warwickshire, and his wife Anne Clobery (1664–c. 1738) of Bradstone, Hampshire, along the southern coast of England."
Mirror,13th - 14th Century,Null,Metalwork,"The Japanese used chrysanthemums as decorative elements on mirrors. In the Heian period, a chrysanthemum with cranes or long-tailed birds was a common motif. Later, in the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, chrysanthemum designs were divided into three patterns with different symbolic associations: Chrysanthemum with Cranes represented longevity; Water Flowing suggested longevity as well as the Noh drama Kikujido, or Chrysanthemum Boy; and East Fence alluded to the poem ""Drinking Wine"" by Tao Yuanming (AD 365-427). Here, the mirror featuring Buddhist iconography (kyojo) and a chrysanthemum design on the back shows that the flower was also appreciated in the context of Buddhism in the Kamakura period."
"Flowers of a Hundred Worlds (Momoyogusa), vols. 1–3",20th Century,Japan,Books,"This set of three woodblock printed folding-books displays the graphic design prowess of Kamisaka Sekka. The images were first distributed one by one to subscribers to the series but later were reissued in bound form, like these books, for mass consumers. Each print features a vignette taken from nature or Japanese literature. Many of the scenes have a long history in Japan, originating in the 900s or 1000s and having been interpreted by all manner of artists since that time. Sekka’s selections hew closely to precedents from the Rinpa style originated by painter Tawaraya Sōtatsu (c. 1570–c. 1640) and calligrapher Hon’ami Kōetsu (1558–1637)."
Mirror with Pair of Cranes in Chrysanthemum Pattern,14th - 16th Century,Null,Metalwork,"The Japanese used chrysanthemums as decorative elements on mirrors. In the Heian period, a chrysanthemum with cranes or long-tailed birds was a common motif. Later, in the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, chrysanthemum designs were divided into three patterns with different symbolic associations: Chrysanthemum with Cranes represented longevity; Water Flowing suggested longevity as well as the Noh drama Kikujido, or Chrysanthemum Boy; and East Fence alluded to the poem ""Drinking Wine"" by Tao Yuanming (AD 365-427). Here, the mirror featuring Buddhist iconography (kyojo) and a chrysanthemum design on the back shows that the flower was also appreciated in the context of Buddhism in the Kamakura period."
Lily of the Valley Comb,20th Century,France,Jewelry,"This comb was purchased by Cleveland native Jeptha Homer Wade II from Lalique after admiring the designer's work at the 1900 Exposition Universelle in Paris, probably for his wife Ellen Garretson Wade. Pearlescent horn forms the leaves of the lily of the valley, out of which the delicate, bell-shaped enamel flowers emerge."

New Suite of Portfolios of Flowers Ideal to Use for Designing and Painting: Floral Fantasies,18th Century,France,Print,"As a painter and decorative artist,Jean Baptiste Pillement ornamented a broad range of objects including ceramics, textiles, and other household objects. He employed several printmakers to copy his designs that were then disseminated throughout Europe. The best of the printmakers, Anne Allen, colored the etched plate à la poupée. Instead of making a plate for each color, a single plate is selectively inked in different colors using stumps of rags, known as dolls (poupée in French), so that the complete design is printed at one time."
Quatrelobed Dish from Dessert Service: Coxcomb,19th Century,England,Ceramics,"Each dish is decorated with recognizable plants, the names of which are inscribed on the base in both Latin and English. Identifying the blossoms only became customary in the late 18th century when a single piece of porcelain was decorated with one species, and flowers were represented along with leaves, stems, seed pods, and roots. All of this reflects Carolus Linnaeus’s recent invention of a scientific method to categorize all known flora. The decorations on the Derby factory’s products derive from contemporary English botanical publications. For instance, illustrations in William Curtis’s The Botanical Magazine served as models for the French marigold and nettle-leaved bell flower on the dessert service."

Nine Celestial Bodies (Navagraha),8th Century,Null,Sculpture,"Near temple entrances, the nine celestial bodies were depicted in an orderly row, often in figural form. From left to right they are: Sun with a tall crown and the female Dawn in front of him. The next five figures are nearly identical: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. As a portent of doom, Saturn was wounded by a goddess to prevent him from moving swiftly, so he stands on one leg. The bodiless head is Rahu, the eclipse, who swallows the moon until it falls out his neck. The serpent-tailed figure is a comet."

Violette Heymann,20th Century,France,Drawing,"Although he was known early in his career for works primarily in black and white, such as charcoal drawings and lithographs, Odilon Redon turned to more colorful media, including pastel, later on. In particular, he focused on commissioned pastel portraits of women with flowers, such as this one. Here, the young niece of the Parisian collector Marcel Kapferer appears alongside colorful blossoms as she looks forward, focused as if in the dreamlike state evoked by her surroundings."
Pomona Britannica: No. 33 - Peaches,19th Century,England,Print,"This color aquatint etching is one plate from George Brookshaw’s 1812 illustrated volume Pomona Britannica. Named after the Roman goddess of fruit trees, gardens, and orchards, Brookshaw intended the volume to be the English “country gentleman’s” guide to the science of classifying and identifying fruits (pomology). Many of Brookshaw’s models came from the Royal Gardens at Hampton Court and Kensington Gardens. Each print featured one fruit, often life-size, including detailed depictions of its flower and leaves. Printed in color with hand-painted highlights, this and other illustrated botanicals formed an essential part of the cultured English library in the early 19th century."

Scenes from the Life of Buddha,2nd Century,Null,Sculpture,"In this compact narrative relief, which was made to adorn a Buddhist stupa, scenes from the early life of the Buddha are depicted in order from top to bottom. His birth is at the top. The infant, now broken, is being received by Indra, King of the Gods, from the right side of his mother, who is depicted like a tree deity, grasping a branch with one hand. The baby Buddha miraculously took seven steps immediately after he was born, as indicated by the standing diminutive figure at the left of the scene. The next scene depicts the bodhisattva Maitreya, who will be the next Buddha to be born in the future, as an element of foreshadowing. Returning to the life of the historical Buddha, the sculptors then depict him as a prince, enjoying palace life with his wife. Eventually, he is compelled to leave his family to seek enlightenment and try to end the suffering in the world. In the lowest panel he rides off to the forest with a carved halo behind his head. In the border areas are meditating Buddha images, worshippers, guardians, and earth deities who drag a massive flower garland adorning the panel."
Lotus No. 12,20th Century,China,Print,"Chen Qi's works often show a single object up close. Here an open lotus flower set against a black ink ground evokes the image of a blossom merged into and reflecting the bright moonlight. At close view, the bulging petals defined by crisp printed lines show fine veins in relief, embossed into the paper and achieved through a blind impressed wooden block that has no ink.Chen Qi has been awarded many prizes for his art on a national and international level, including a gold medal at the 13th National Print Exhibition in 1996 in Beijing. He has exhibited in Europe and Asia, including Paris, Geneva, Kuala Lumpur, and New Delhi."
Fatima,20th Century,Austria,Textile,"Inspired by English cotton chintz patterns, Josef Frank created several designs for cotton textiles used as clothing. Fatima was likely meant for summer evening gowns due to the cotton’s light weight. The design’s vibrant floral motifs in intricate arrangements would have made a fresh and fashionable impression without overemphasizing the pattern’s geometry."
Bouquet,17th Century,France,Print,"Seventeenth-century botanical illustrators were stimulated by a surge of interest in their subject. While in the mid-16th century only 500 plants were known, less than a century later that number had grown to 6,000. A passion for cultivating beautiful rather than useful plants took hold, and formal gardens with carefully arranged flower beds based on embroidery designs supplemented varieties of local plants with foreign samples. Exotic flowers became available in Europe as the Dutch founded colonies in the East and West Indies, South America, and India. While fabulous royal gardens were planted in France at Fontainebleau and the Louvre, for instance, in England “a whole nation went mad about flowers.”"

Millefiori Bowl,1st Century,Null,Glass,"Mosaic glass, also called millefiori, was cast in a two-part mold. Fused glass rods of different colors were bundled together into patterns, then sliced into disk-shaped cross sections. These were placed within the mold and heated until fused. After cooling, the vessel’s surface was fire- or wheel-polished."

"Krishna sporting with the gopis in the Jumna River, from a Bhagavata Purana",16th Century,Null,Painting,"This page is from one of the earliest surviving illustrated Hindu manuscripts from India. It belongs to an extensive series on the life of Krishna, an incarnation of Vishnu. Shown here in blue, frolicking energetically with a bevy of young women from the cowherder village where he lived as a youth, Krishna is in the middle of the composition and the center of attention. Celestial musicians offer flower garlands and beat percussion instruments in the skies to accompany their passionate play. Lively gestures and bold patterning of the water lend to the exuberance of the scene."

Yellow Chrysanthemums and Red Osmanthus in the Style of Wang Yuan,15th Century,China,Painting,"Shen Zhou, a native from Suzhou, was descended from a prominent land-owning family with strong ties to literati culture. Because Shen Zhou never entered government service, he had ample opportunity to cultivate the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy.Chrysanthemums and red osmanthus both bloom in autumn. The deep orange osmanthus flowers emanate a characteristically sweet fragrance. According to his inscription on the painting, Shen Zhou sought to imitate the style of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) painter Wang Yuan. His color-filled brushstrokes and washes, however, anticipate the flower painting style of Yun Shouping, whose Peonies are also in the Cleveland Museum of Art collection, https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1967.192. The sheer size and complex composition of this scroll are impressive."
"Four-armed goddess, with hearts in margin",20th Century,Null,Painting,"This goddess holds a lotus flower and a discus, along with two other unidentified objects. Historically, Madhubani paintings were murals created with brushes made of bamboo and cotton. They ornamented domestic spaces on the occasion of a festival or rite of passage in a woman's life, such as a birth or a wedding. In the wake of a drought in 1966, the All India Handicrafts Board encouraged women of the Mithila region make paintings on paper, so they could sell them and help support their communities."
"The Lovelorn Heroine, from a Sat Sai of Bihari",18th Century,Null,Painting,"The Sat Sai is a collection of poems mainly describing the beauty of women in a range of emotional states. The heroine of this poem sits against a tree that is in full flower, like her, but her lover is absent, and other girls walk by, gossiping. Not coincidentally, her dress matches the color of the blossoms, and no bees come to pollinate."
Untitled (Farm Animals),19th Century,France,Photograph,"This charming view of village life by Braun is one of only about five known large-scale prints produced from a small number of negatives. It represents one of the earliest studies of animals not portrayed by a daguerreotype. This complex and densely filled composition is beautifully balanced and enhanced by the skillful use of natural light in order to highlight the animals. The abundant clarity of detail suggests that Braun intended to market these photographs to visual artists as models for their compositions, just as he did with flower studies accomplished around the same time."
Youth as a Stand-in Monju,18th Century,Japan,Print,"In this image, a handsome young man replaces the Buddhist figure Monju, a bodhisattva—or enlightened being—often shown riding a lion. Monju symbolizes wisdom and customarily holds a sword and a sacred text atop a lotus flower. The youth here meditates instead on his tobacco kit and a long pipe. The print was once paired with another, showing a young woman replacing Fugen, a bodhisattva who rides an elephant."
Étude de fleurs d'après nature:  Spray of Flowers,Date Unknown,France,Print,"Crayon manner etching was invented in the 18th century to simulate the texture of chalk drawings, which were very popular at the time. A tool with toothed points of varying thicknesses set at irregular intervals and angles (mattoir) imitated the random character of grains of chalk on textured paper. Etudes de fleurs d’après nature demonstrates how prints propagated floral designs that could be used in the applied arts. Artisans designing textiles or decorating furniture, for instance, were inspired by the compositions found on prints."
"Vase with Inlaid Lotus, Plum, and Bamboo Design",14th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Flattened-shaped jars like this one started to appear around the late 13th century. Each of the flattened sides is decorated with an image of a lotus flower pond, enclosed in a lobed panel. The protruding sides, on the other hand, depict an image of bamboo trees and plum blossoms. This particular example seems to have been produced in the late 14th century, when the overall quality of techniques involved in making celadon works sharply deteriorated. In contrast to translucent greenish blue celadon works of the 12th century, this flask has gray greenish glaze due to less refined clay. Furthermore, its rather roughly executed inlaid design shows a clear sign of decline in craftsmanship. Nevertheless, less attention to technical details gave way to a freer style pottery called buncheong in the succeeding centuries."
Round Box with Bird and Peonies Design,14th Century,Null,Lacquer,"The carved lacquer box and lobed silver container nearby both feature pairs of birds and flowers on their covers. There is a striking similarity in decoration, shape, and aesthetic appeal. Both boxes suggest that successful designs and shapes circulated among craftsmen, workshops, and beyond regional borders."
"The parrot addresses Khujasta at the beginning of the forty-first night, from a Tuti-nama (Tales of a Parrot): Forty-first Night",16th Century,Null,Painting,"On the forty-first of fifty-two nights, Khujasta consults Tuti the parrot for advice on how to balance her lover’s wishes with her vow of marriage. Tuti, perched atop his cage, responds by telling her a story about a donkey who was punished for singing too brazenly."
Hevajra,13th Century,Null,Sculpture,"Hevajra was an important figure signaling the practice of Buddhist rituals. King Jayavarman VII placed particular emphasis on Hevajra during consecration rituals and set up a colossal stone sculpture of dancing Hevajra at the east gate of his fortified city in the Khmer capital at Angkor. In the Cambodia of Jayavarman VII, tantric Buddhism became public and widespread, practiced together with other more mainstream forms of Buddhism, Hinduism, and ancestor worship. The iconography of Hevajra is described in detail in a text that bears his name, the Hevajra-tantra, first composed in India probably in the 800s. Hevajra has eight heads, sixteen arms, and four legs. His left hands hold images of Indic gods; wealth, death, sun, moon, fire, wind, water, and earth. In his right hands are animals: bull, lion, human, cat, camel, sheep, horse, and elephant. They all sit in skull cups, objects also used in tantric rituals. He dances on a corpse that embodies ignorance and is surrounded by eight yoginis who dance triumphantly in a ring around him. Yoginis functioned as intercessors between human practitioners and enlightened beings. Many bronze images of Hevajra were made during the reign of Jayavarman VII, but few survive in as pristine condition as this example. According to scientific analysis and curatorial reports, this sculpture survived in a clay vessel submerged in water, which accounts for its high tin content and unusual gray patina. Samples from the clay core reveal the presence of the mineral feldspar, a characteristic of clay from the Isaan plateau, on the other side of the mountain range not far from Banteay Chhmar, in present-day Thailand."
Section from a Portable Shrine,2nd Century,Null,Sculpture,"Figures of deities who protect children are featured in this relief carving. A form of Skanda holding a bird and a flower stands next to a regal yakshi with pointed rodent or elephant ears. A diminutive figure who may be a child is shown kneeling at his feet. Above, the six-headed mother goddess Shashthi sits next to Skanda, holding the spear."
Portrait of a Woman with Flowers,20th Century,United States,Photograph,"For more than 50 years, James VanDerZee produced images that embody the spirit of Harlem. From the 1920s to the 1940s, he was the neighborhood's most popular and prolific photographer, his camera capturing everyone from ordinary citizens to celebrities. In the studio VanDerZee photographed glamorously dressed young people and dignified men and women. On location, he chronicled picnics, parades, families, church congregations, and the dead in their coffins. These four prints, from a collection of 33 recently acquired by the museum, show VanDerZee's skill at posing and lighting his subjects. His artistic sensibilities are reflected in elaborate backdrops and the use of accessories that reinforced his sitters' associations with culture and wealth. The artist worked with a variety of techniques, including multiple negatives and hand coloring, to make artful photographs that set him apart from his more traditional, less aesthetically inclined competitors. Just as he often signed his name and date directly onto the negative, he would also selectively draw on it-to smooth a complexion and touch up imperfections, or to add extra jewelry or smoke drifting from a cigarette-whatever was necessary to emphasize the grace and dignity of his client, regardless of race, age, or social status."

"Hatsuito of the Yamashiroya Likened to Bush Clover, from Beauties of the Floating World Compared to Flowers",18th Century,Japan,Print,"Courtesan Hatsuito of a brothel named Yamashiroya is likened to autumnal bush clover in this series comparing the qualities of courtesans to flowers. Hatsuito ties her servant’s obi sash while a gibbon emerges from a painting in the room’s viewing alcove to offer a love letter on which Hatsuito’s name appears. Gibbons reaching in vain for the moon’s reflection in water is a common metaphor for the deluded mind, and bush clover in moonlight is a popular seasonal motif. Here, the ideas are combined as the gibbon woos this unattainable beauty."
Armchair,19th Century,United States,Furniture,"Louis Comfort Tiffany began his artistic career as a painter, having studied with George Innes and Samuel Colman in America as well as with various artists in Paris. While he achieved some early success with his orientalist works, his interests were soon drawn to interior furnishings and design. He collaborated with other artisans to form Associated Artists in 1879 and began work on major commissions such as the Mark Twain House (1881) and the White House for President Chester Arthur (1882). He debuted designs for furniture at the 1893 Chicago world's fair, and this armchair is believed to have been among those pieces. Even after he achieved enormous success with his glass production, Tiffany continued to produce interior furnishings and design schemes for artistic interiors throughout the rest of his career."
Border Strips of a Skirt,17th - 18th Century,Null,Embroidery,"The primary motif is a large stylized flowering vase with fantastic flowers and foliage, two small figures sitting among the foliage, two birds at the top eating flowers and, in the center, a double-headed eagle. Two of these motifs appear on the large strip, separated by a much smaller flowering vase with two goat-like animals at the base. At the top and bottom is a border of arched compartments containing, alternately, a flower and a two-tailed mermaid or a double-headed eagle."
A feast in a pavilion setting,17th Century,India,Painting,"Two gentlemen sit on a low carpeted platform in a walled garden. They wear bulbous turbans meant to indicate a historical time or distant place other than Mughal India. Behind them is the entry of a wealthy family’s house with one of the double doors open, leading to the inner quarters and a covered pavilion on the rooftop. The vestibule’s rear wall is ornamented with niches and wall paintings. Emperor Jahangir admired Persian art and culture, employing Persian painters such as Muhammad Ali in his royal atelier. He enjoyed gatherings such as this, with books and music, wine and fruits."

The illuminator of this leaf incorporated a more subtle decorative scheme consisting of a large, flower-filled initial D for Deus that gives a focus to the page. A rectangular bar border with ivy leaf sprays punctuated with flowers in the corners flows from this initial. The layout is neat, yet elegant. The palette of orange-reds and pale blues is typically English."

Incense Burner with Lotus Petal Design in Relief,12th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Celadons wares used for everyday such as this incense burner were among the most common burial objects in tombs during the Goryeo period (918–1392). Furnishing tombs with an elaborate assemblage of objects was believed to honor and comfort the newly dead. Generally, Goryeo tombs were left untouched until the late 19th century. During the colonial period (1910–45), however, Japanese archaeologists competitively excavated the tombs located in Kaeseong, the former capital of the Goryeo period, and these wares soon became available for Japanese and Western collectors."
"Lotuses, Insects, and Birds",19th Century,Null,Painting,"Pairs of herons, kingfishers, and dragonflies punctuate a profusion of lotus in this composition that, given the orientation of the herons and the clustering of motifs in the left-hand side of the work, may have once been the left painting of a pair. Given its subject matter, this hanging scroll may have been hung for display during the summer."
Figure of a Gardener,18th Century,England,Ceramics,"Even though this figure and her counterpart (1945.37) are not accompanied by a sheep, these ceramic sculptures were sometimes known as “Garland Shepherds” during the mid-1700s. The name derived from a similar set produced by one of the Bow Porcelain Factory’s rivals, the Derby Porcelain Factory, in which the male figure holds a lamb. While these two factories often produced similar sets of pastoral, allegorical, biographical, and religious figures, the Bow Factory was known as one of the preeminent porcelain manufacturers, rivaled only by the Chelsea Porcelain Factory, with which Bow would later merge."
Figures Depicting the Four Seasons,18th Century,England,Ceramics,"In this group depicting the four seasons, a young boy in ice skates represents winter; a young lady adorns her hair with flowers in spring; a young man guards his beehive in summer; and a girl gathers fruit in autumn."
Shalabhanjika (Woman and Tree),4th - 5th Century,Null,Sculpture,"The full carving of a flowering tree on the back of this figurine indicates that she is a figure of a nature divinity who personifies the life-giving qualities of the sap that envigorates the tree and causes it to flower. These figures are sometimes called shalabhanjika, ""she who breaks the tree,"" probably because her fertile properties are so powerful that it causes the tree to fruit so heavily that the branches break."
Stand-in Fugen,18th - 19th Century,Japan,Painting,"Here, a woman dressed as a man replaces Fugen, a bodhisattva—a being among those considered enlightened in Buddhism—who symbolizes learning as a path to awakening and typically rides an elephant. The painting teaches the lesson of impermanence through the petals falling from the lotus flower the woman holds. It also alludes to the legend of Eguchi, a 12th-century courtesan who, following an encounter with a Buddhist monk-poet called Saigyō, revealed herself to be a manifestation of Fugen."
Water-Moon Kannon (Suigetsu Kannon),19th - 20th Century,Null,Painting,"Kannon represents a primary figure of benevolence and compassion in the Buddhist pantheon. Identified early in Buddhist texts as a close attendant to the Buddha, by the 700s Kannon's popularity soared to such an extent in China, Korea, and Japan that the bodhisattva was often worshipped independently. Here at the lower left, Kannon is depicted with the child Zenzai Dōji (Sakskrit: Sudhana), a wealthy boy who, according to the final chapter of the Flower Garland Sutra, visited Kannon's abode Fudaraka (Sanskrit: Potalaka) during a long journey to learn the bodhisattva path."
Flora [II],20th Century,Austria,Textile,"Also affectionately called Pepi’s Flora after Josef Frank’s childhood nickname “Pepi,” this design depicts imaginary wildflowers concocted by Frank. The whimsically placed yet tightly packed flowers are meant to evoke flowers in the background as well as the borders of French tapestries."
In Praise of Verse: Autumnal Equinox Buddist Service: Manjusaka Flowers,20th Century,Japan,Print,"An ardent Zen Buddhist, Munakata frequently portrayed Buddhist themes in his prints. His style was inspired in part by the direct and simple imagery of popular medieval Buddhist prints and 18th-century Japanese folk paintings."
Icon of the Virgin and Child,6th Century,Null,Textile,"This tapestry glorifying the Virgin Mary is among the rarest objects in the museum’s collection. In a composition borrowed from imperial Byzantine art, Mary is shown seated on a jeweled throne with the Christ child and flanked by archangels Michael and Gabriel. Above, Christ appears in a radiant light supported by two angels. Portraits of the apostles, identified in Greek, appear in the surrounding wreath symbolizing eternal life. This portable sacred textile was presumably displayed at the front of a public or private place of worship. This unique tapestry is one of the earliest Christian icons to survive. Woven icons were among the miraculous works shown to pilgrims in Jerusalem according to Abbot Adomnan of Iona (about 624–704) who described a linen cloth ""said to have been woven by Saint Mary, and is for this reason preserved in a church and venerated by the whole population. Pictures of the twelve apostles are woven into it, and there is also a portrait of the Lord."" The abbot’s description of the woven icon suggests it must have been similar to the tapestry displayed here. The delicate effects of shading in the facial features, garments, and vegetation were achieved by weaving the panel sideways with at least 20 colors, just as medieval tapestry weavers did centuries later in Europe. The high cost of dyes caused this majestic icon to be far costlier than painted images."
Seated Buddha,12th Century,Null,Lacquer,"This rare image of the historical Buddha Shakyamuni is shown seated with crossed legs in the position of meditation. His left hand rests on his lap, referring to his meditation under the Bodhi tree, and his right hand is in the earth-touching gesture—calling the earth to witness his enlightenment. The Buddha sits on a double lotus pedestal that indicates the presence of a transcendent being. The sculptural style is typical of sculptures made at the Buddhist site of Pagan. Sculptures such as this were installed in niches in an interior passage of a temple. As is typical of Burmese works, this sculpture was carved from a solid piece of wood. Its surface was covered in black lacquer and then gilded; a great deal of the gilding remains intact. Because lacquer is an easily perishable material, works of this type and size are exceedingly rare; this sculpture is one of the best extant examples."
Maharana Jagat Singh Attending the Raslila,18th Century,India,Painting,"To celebrate the New Year festival of Diwali, dancers reenact the life story of the Hindu god Krishna in a palace courtyard by candlelight under the full moon. The king, a vassal of the Mughal emperor, sits with the halo of divine sanction for his rule at the left of the courtyard, smoking from a golden goat-shaped hookah, with his young son and heir at his side. At the top of the composition, a dancer dressed in blue with a peacock-feather crown plays the part of Krishna. In the upper right corner, a canopy painted with swirling storm clouds stands for the rainstorm sent by the jealous king of the gods, who is shown in the middle of the canopy with his consort and mount, the elephant with seven trunks. Guards and grooms in the foreground entertain themselves with music while they wait with the horses of visiting nobles. The formal geometric gardens, playful use of perspective, and individualized portraiture indicate the selective adoption of the styles and sensibilities of the imperial Mughal court in the paintings from this large-format series."
Octafoil Mirror with Two Immortals Crossing the Ocean,10th – 13th Century,Null,Metalwork,"This mirror in the shape of a flower represents two immortals crossing the ocean, surrounded by surging waves. The younger figure on the left wears two buns on his head; the elder one with a long beard is carrying a musical instrument, sheng. The scene may illustrate “The Eight Immortals Crossing the Ocean,” in which their supernatural power to walk on water is depicted. The two men here stand on their swords to travel on water. In Daoist and Buddhist thinking, swords are considered powerful, magical implements to exorcise demons and destroy evil spirits."
New Suite of Portfolios of Flowers Ideal to Use for Designing and Painting: Floral Fantasies,18th Century,England,Print,"As a painter and decorative artist,Jean Baptiste Pillement ornamented a broad range of objects including ceramics, textiles, and other household objects. He employed several printmakers to copy his designs that were then disseminated throughout Europe. The best of the printmakers, Anne Allen, colored the etched plate à la poupée. Instead of making a plate for each color, a single plate is selectively inked in different colors using stumps of rags, known as dolls (poupée in French), so that the complete design is printed at one time."
Black and White Lilies III,20th Century,United States,Photograph,"In the early 1920s, Cunningham combined the clarity and directness of modernism with her long-held interest in botanical imagery. For two decades she created a remarkable group of close-up studies of plants and flowers that identified her as one of the most sophisticated and experimental photographers working in America. In this dramatic, tightly cropped composition, Cunningham isolated two lilies against a simple velvet backdrop. A black calla (arum palaestium) was rhythmically placed in front of a white calla (zantedeschia aethiopica). The expanded scale of the black flower, with its partially visible spadix diagonally positioned, dominates the picture. The sculptural shapes and rich textures were emphasized by the combination of daylight and blue tungsten photofloods and the copious detail provided by the 8x10-inch negative. This sensuous print also encompasses a luxurious range of tones, from velvety black to milky white."
Plate from Dessert Service: Chinese Ixia,19th Century,England,Ceramics,"Each dish is decorated with recognizable plants, the names of which are inscribed on the base in both Latin and English. Identifying the blossoms only became customary in the late 18th century when a single piece of porcelain was decorated with one species, and flowers were represented along with leaves, stems, seed pods, and roots. All of this reflects Carolus Linnaeus’s recent invention of a scientific method to categorize all known flora. The decorations on the Derby factory’s products derive from contemporary English botanical publications. For instance, illustrations in William Curtis’s The Botanical Magazine served as models for the French marigold and nettle leaved bell flower on the dessert service."

Mirror,13th - 14th Century,Null,Metalwork,"The Japanese used chrysanthemums as decorative elements on mirrors. In the Heian period, a chrysanthemum with cranes or long-tailed birds was a common motif. Later, in the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, chrysanthemum designs were divided into three patterns with different symbolic associations: Chrysanthemum with Cranes represented longevity; Water Flowing suggested longevity as well as the Noh drama Kikujido, or Chrysanthemum Boy; and East Fence alluded to the poem ""Drinking Wine"" by Tao Yuanming (AD 365-427). Here, the mirror featuring Buddhist iconography (kyojo) and a chrysanthemum design on the back shows that the flower was also appreciated in the context of Buddhism in the Kamakura period."
"Flowers of a Hundred Worlds (Momoyogusa), vols. 1–3",20th Century,Japan,Books,"This set of three woodblock printed folding-books displays the graphic design prowess of Kamisaka Sekka. The images were first distributed one by one to subscribers to the series but later were reissued in bound form, like these books, for mass consumers. Each print features a vignette taken from nature or Japanese literature. Many of the scenes have a long history in Japan, originating in the 900s or 1000s and having been interpreted by all manner of artists since that time. Sekka’s selections hew closely to precedents from the Rinpa style originated by painter Tawaraya Sōtatsu (c. 1570–c. 1640) and calligrapher Hon’ami Kōetsu (1558–1637)."
Dish,17th Century,England,Silver,"Silver fulfilled a prominent role in projecting wealth, status, power, and ritual in British life during the 1600s and 1700s. Elaborate forms such this shallow dish not only represented wealth in its sheer silver weight but also provided royal and aristocratic owners a surface for displaying engraved coats of arms. For example, this dish is engraved with the arms of Sir Charles Holte (1648–1722), the 3rd Baronet of Warwickshire, and his wife Anne Clobery (1664–c. 1738) of Bradstone, Hampshire, along the southern coast of England."

From left to right they are: Sun with a tall crown and the female Dawn in front of him. The next five figures are nearly identical: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. As a portent of doom, Saturn was wounded by a goddess to prevent him from moving swiftly, so he stands on one leg. The bodiless head is Rahu, the eclipse, who swallows the moon until it falls out his neck. The serpent-tailed figure is a comet."

These were the first botanical prints to enter the collection, which has grown to a large representation of more than 100 prints and related drawings."

Standing Buddha,9th Century,Null,Sculpture,"This small sculpture was probably part of a set of eight main scenes from the life of the Buddha, each identified by a specific hand gesture. When the standing Buddha gestures down with his right hand, with the palm facing out, he usually signals his miraculous descent from the Heaven of the Thirty-three Gods, where he once spent a monsoon season giving teachings to his mother. She died shortly after his birth and was reborn in the heaven."
Dragon in foliage with lion and phoenix heads,16th Century,Turkey,Drawing,"A dragon lunges toward a pearl in the form of a seal inscribed with a verse from the Koran: “And I commit my case unto God” (40:44). In his front claw, the dragon grasps two flowering branches that magically produce a variety of blooms, including a lion that bites the dragon’s neck and a phoenix, who competes for the pearl. Sahkulu was trained by Persian artists, as were many artists of Mughal India during the 1500s. He joined the Ottoman imperial painting atelier in Istanbul in 1526 and became the head in 1545."

A poetic inscription by the monk Ekkei Reikaku accompanies this gentle composition of two sparrows perched on bamboo."
"The Temple of Flora, or Garden of Nature:  A Group of Auriculas",19th Century,England,Print,"The greatest English botanical publication of the early 19th century was Dr. Robert John Thornton’s Temple of Flora. Although Thornton studied medicine, his passion was botany and he soon embarked upon a major publishing venture that brought him both fame and financial ruin. The work, New Illustrations of the Sexual System of Linnaeus, was the most sumptuous botanical publication ever produced. The third section, the famous Temple of Flora, has 28 flower portraits set not against a plain conventional background but in the full richness of their natural setting. Unfortunately the day of the great florilegia had passed and Thornton died in poverty in 1837."

Trembling Woods,19th Century,France,Print,"The coloration of the trees in the background, where the tone modulates from dark in the foliage to lighter and lighter in the trunks, was achieved with a technique borrowed from Japanese color woodcuts. The art of Japan is also apparent in the monochrome flower pattern above and below the image that imitates the silk scrolls on which paintings are hung. The poem, by Charles Cros, can be translated as: Shivering trees / Starry sky / My well-beloved has gone away / Taking with him my broken heart / Wind, let your plaintive murmurs / And you nightingale let your songs / Tell him that I am dying"

Amitābha Triad,15th Century,Null,Painting,"This hanging scroll illustrates an apparition of Buddha Amitābha (阿彌陀 in Chinese) and two attendant bodhisattvas, in the midst of colorful light and swirling clouds. The one who carries a miniature image of Amitābha in its jeweled crown is Avalokiteśvara (觀音 in Chinese); the other who carries a flower vase is Mahāsthāmaprāpta (大勢至 in Chinese).Previously, this work was identified as a rare example of a Korean Buddhist painting from the early Joseon period. In contrast to surviving Korean works from this time the scroll stands out for its fine details. However, other elements such as the striped almond-shaped halo that encircles the main Buddha, firm red lines that define each deity’s facial features, and the flowing garments may identify it as an early Ming period Chinese Buddhist painting."

Fragment of Silk Taffeta with “Rose and Nightingale” Motif,18th Century,Null,Textile,"A luxurious textile like this would have been used for courtly robes or coats in Safavid Iran. The bird-and-flower motif is known as gul-u-bulbul in Persian, meaning “rose and nightingale.” The motif references the poetic image of a nightingale plaintively singing to an indifferent rose as a metaphor for unrequited human love as well as the soul’s desire for mystical union with the divine."
"The Flowering of Joseph's Rod, folio 11 (verso), from a Mirror of Holiness (Mir’at al-quds) of Father Jerome Xavier",17th Century,Null,Manuscript,"This painting illustrates a story that introduces Joseph into the narrative. When Mary came of age to wed, the high priests ordered every eligible man to bring a rod to the temple. When they prayed for a sign from God to determine which suitor was worthy, the rod belonging to Joseph burst into bloom. The painter has depicted Joseph’s hat on the ground as if it fell off his head in a sudden movement of surprise. The suitors in this scene are dressed as contemporary Portuguese men, but have followed the Muslim practice of removing their shoes while in the temple."
"Goddesses Lakshmi and Sarasvati (verso), from a Kalighat album",19th Century,Null,Painting,"This is a symmetrical painting of two goddesses, each standing on a lotus (symbolizing beauty and purity). Both are considered in Bengali folklore to be sisters and the daughters of the goddess Durga. Lakshmi, goddess of fortune, prosperity, and beauty, and wife of Vishnu, is holding an unfinished flower. Sarasvati, goddess of knowledge, learning, and patroness of the fine arts, is holding a stringed instrument, which represents refined training and education. Sarasvati is white skinned, signifying purity."

Female Devotee,2nd Century,Null,Stone,"This female devotee is depicted approaching the place of worship carrying a covered wicker tray that would have been filled with fresh flower garlands.The sense of dynamism and power in the stance, the masterful transformation of stone into the suppleness of youthful, voluptuous flesh barely interrupted by clothing, as well as touches of naturalism—seen in the slipping of the large bangle down the spiral cuff—are all stylistic characteristics of female figures made during the early 2nd century."
Winged Atlas-Hercules,3rd Century,Null,Sculpture,"In Buddhist art of the Gandharan region during the time of heightened contact with the Mediterranean world, the figure of Atlas was adopted, but given wings so as to appear superhuman. This figure has been conflated with the image of Hercules, who wears the skin of the Nemean lion, and relieved Atlas of his duties for a short time. Repeated images of composite Atlas-like figures surrounded the base of the monuments called stupas, which were solid domes, and can be understood as symbols for the sky, which would have appeared as though supported by rows of titanic figures. Other examples of this figure hold a thunderbolt (vajra) in one hand, suggesting that he could also allude to Vajrapani, an early protector divinity of the Buddha. Images of Vajrapani can combine attributes of Hercules, Zeus, and Hermes."
"Bull Skull, Fruit, Pitcher",20th Century,Spain,Painting,"Picasso painted this still life on January 29, 1939, just after the death of his mother and the fall of his beloved Barcelona to the fascists during the Spanish civil war. This painting expresses Picasso's despair through the bull's skull covered with decaying flesh, perhaps symbolizing brutality and darkness. Amid the horror and anguish, a flowering tree referring to the sacred oak of Guernica sprouts in the moonlight, suggesting hope for the rebirth of democracy in Spain."

Buddhist Surplice (Kesa),20th Century,Null,Garment,"The kesa is a Buddhist monk’s vestment worn folded and draped over one shoulder, and fastened over the chest. In keeping with the austere conditions of monastic life, kesa were traditionally fashioned from remainders of donated garments sewn together into a series of columns. The wider, central column symbolizes the Buddha. The orange squares with a phoenix and flower pattern in each corner represent the deities who guard the four directions, while the two at the top on either side of the central column symbolize attendant bodhisattvas, or the Nio, guardians who protect the Buddhist Law. This kesa is sewn from a textile with bold roundels with dragon and phoenix motifs."
"Centerpiece, or Jardinière",19th Century,Null,Metalwork,"Regrettably, a maker's mark does not appear on this piece: thus the factory that made it remains unknown.

Primavera [II],20th Century,Null,Textile,"Though designed in Austria, this textile was block-printed by the English company G. P. and J. Baker based in London. In block printing every color requires a separate block, indicating that production of this design required 35 or more blocks. The design is now screenprinted, produced, and marketed by the Stockholm-based firm Svenskt Tenn. The name is derived from the Italian Renaissance painting Primavera by Sandro Botticelli dating to the late 1400s, which Josef Frank saw while visiting Florence. Botticelli’s painting features a forest floor strewn with identifiable wildflowers, an approach that Frank incorporated whimsically by arranging recognizable tulips, daisies, and violets, among other species."
Dish with Incised Scroll Design,10th - 12th Century,Null,Ceramics,"While this dish was donated as a rare white celadon excavated from a Goryeo period tomb, it turns out to be a Song period Chinese Qingbai ware much enjoyed as a luxury item among Korean ruling elites in the Goryeo period (918–1392)."
Worshippers Giving Offerings to the Bodhi Tree,2nd Century,Null,Sculpture,"The square railing surrounding the base of the trunk is the marker of a sacred tree. This tree has the distinctive heart-shaped leaves of the Bodhi tree (ficus religiosa), which is the type of tree under which the Buddha reached enlightenment. Each of the the worshippers holds a narrow-necked pot with lotus flowers emerging from the mouth. The lotus flowers are a symbol for water, so these figures are pouring offerings of pure water to the sacred tree."
Colossal Head of a Deva,13th Century,Null,Stone,"This head is from one of the gods (devas in Sanskrit) who, according to Hindu myth, churned the primordial Ocean of Milk to extract the nectar of immortality. Using a mountain as a churning rod and a serpent as the rope, the gods on one side and the demons on the other vied to win the nectar. The gods prevailed and achieved immortality."

One outcome of this phenomenon in the visual arts was the detailed portrayal of plant, animal, and marine life. This painting is an assemblage of objects carefully observed from nature, but not usually seen together."
Rana Amar Singh II (reigned 1698–1710) smoking a hookah,18th Century,Null,Painting,"The ruler of the Hindu kingdom in southern Rajasthan is depicted in the manner of a Mughal portrait. His muslin tunic is belted with a sash that has flowering plants embroidered on the border, which was popularized at the court of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. Other Mughal characteristics include the color of the background and the flowering plants along the lower border. Sandalwood paste explains the dark areas around his chest and arms."
Deep Mountain Stream,21st Century,Japan,Painting,"This abstracted ink landscape, with its dramatic mountain stream, is captured with a bird’s-eye view. It was produced late in the career of the artist, whose oeuvre includes landscapes, bird-and-flower and figure paintings in ink and sometimes bright colors. An industrial designer by profession, Araki’s landscapes reveal his personal devotion to traditional Chinese brush methods, learned first as a youth in China, and later through emulation of famed painter Zhang Daqian (1899–1983) in Taiwan."
Bodhisattva  Manjushri: Lord of Wisdom,11th - 12th Century,Null,Sculpture,"The Bodhisattva of Wisdom can be identified by the lion mount, the horizontal palm-leaf manuscript on the lotus above his left shoulder, and the stupa above his head. His seat and footrests are lotus flowers, indicating transcendence of the ordinary world."
Female torso,11th Century,Null,Sculpture,"This life-size sculpture of a female figure was likely installed by a doorway or in an exterior niche of a Buddhist temple. Throughout the history of Indian art, voluptuous female figures have adorned Buddhist sanctuaries. Embodying the Indian ideal of female beauty, the form of the young mother with full breasts of milk personifies abundance, nourishment, and productivity—ideas that were considered auspicious and life affirming. Her copious jewels and valuable textiles also visually relate that the good karmic actions of venerating the Buddha and following his teachings will result in abundant good fortune."

Portrait of the Marquise d'Aguirandes,18th Century,France,Painting,"Like many French portraitists active during the ancien régime, François-Hubert Drouais was skilled at veiling the physical imperfections of his subjects. This portrait certainly has this quality: the face has been idealized, smoothed, and perfected, but the focus of the painting is less on the Marquise and more on her elegant gown, which is a particularly fine rendering of eighteenth-century printed cloth, with the brilliant gold and white fabric strewn with meticulously detailed flowers and lace."
Hand Mirror,20th Century,France,Miscellaneous,"We often think of art as the work of just one person. In the case of this mirror, its harmonious appearance conceals the number of people involved in its creation. The designer Félix Bracquemond was commissioned by wealthy banker Baron Joseph Vitta to create decorative objects for his multiple homes. Bracquemond worked with other artists in making this mirror: well-known sculptor Auguste Rodin created the figure of Venus; artisan Alexandre Riquet fashioned the elaborate enameled decoration; and goldsmiths from Parisian jewelers Falize Frères completed the mirror and its blue translucent frame embedded with yellow, pink, and white flowers. Through close collaboration between patron, designer, and artists, this mirror represents the trend at the end of the 1800s for blending artistic specialties to create a single work of art. The CMA’s collection includes Bracquemond’s preparatory drawings for the mirror and Rodin’s carved plaster model for the figure of Venus."

Cherry Blossoms in the Wind,18th Century,Japan,Print,"Highly regarded for his images of actors, Toyokuni was also known for his prints of beauties that demonstrate his brilliant skill in composition. This triptych depicts a joyful hanami (flower viewing) scene in spring. One woman stands on a huge wine bottle, while another one sits on a samurai’s shoulder; in both scenes, the women are tying prayers or poems on tree branches. On the left, two servants protect a well-dressed lady from the wind. Their fluttering, long-sleeved kimonos capture the wind’s movement. Standing in a triad, the three groups form a stable, harmonic composition against the cherry blossom background."
Embroidery with Birds,8th - 9th Century,Null,Embroidery,"These engaging little birds are embroidered in a naturalistic style that developed during the 8th and 9th centuries. All but one are oriented away from the central pair that flanks a tulip growing from a hill. Contrasting with the spontaneity of the birds is the structured pattern of the silk ground—rosettes within a lozenge grid. Such contrasts frequently occur among embroideries of the Tang dynasty. Also characteristic of embroideries from that period is the use of discrete areas of color with no attempts at shading. The form of the birds, the hill, and the flower are based on Persian models. The introduction of foreign motifs into the decorative arts of Central Asia and China was one of the most important results of active trading in precious objects along the Silk Road."
Wedding Gown,19th Century,Null,Garment,"This wedding gown is exquisitely embroidered with various symbols of happiness in colorful silk threads. Butterflies stand for marital happiness; the phoenix, numerous offspring; and lotus flowers and white cranes, longevity. Yet, the bridal gown does not attest to the life of luxury. To the contrary, many traces of repairs, trimmings, and patchwork, reflect Joseon-period women’s commitment to value neo-Confucian aesthetics of frugality and modesty. Substantial repairs and patching reveal that this gown served as an important communal resource to be shared and passed down through several generations. Only its collar and sleeves, which are made of thick paper, are replaced with new ones, while the robe was reused for decades."
"Puppies, Sparrows, and Chrysanthemums",18th Century,Japan,Painting,"These paintings were originally mounted as sliding doors (fusuma) used inside a building. The circular areas on the paintings’ paper surfaces are traces of the former positions of the door pulls (hikite). A flock of sparrows gathers on a trellis supporting flowering chrysanthemum. Below is a litter of puppies, some cavorting, others napping. The tender story created by the curious puppy peering up and tilting its head to listen to the bird’s insistent call in the leftmost part of the composition is characteristic of Nagasawa Rosetsu’s paintings, which often use animals to illustrate the human condition."
Ros och Lilja (Rose and Lily),20th Century,Sweden,Textile,This design was likely conceived when Ingrid “Gocken” Jobs was a student of graphic design at the Konstakademin (Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts). Rose and Lily shows a sampling of indigenous Swedish flowers against a black background. The loose floral arrangement is typical of Gocken Jobs’s whimsical style.
Victoria Dubourg,19th Century,France,Drawing,"This drawing is one of several studies that Edgar Degas created for a painted portrait of the artist Victoria Dubourg, now in the collection of the Toledo Museum of Art. Here, Degas concentrated on the facial expression of Dubourg, known for her still-lifes of flowers. Attempting to precisely render Dubourg's direct gaze, Degas drew her eyes in greater detail, even adding an additional sketch along the sheet's upper margin."
Gateway Bracket,2nd - 3rd Century,Null,Sculpture,"Gateways leading into a sacred area often had large horizontal architraves, the weight of which was supported by brackets carved with figures of voluptuous women grasping the branch of a tree. They embody the ideal form of the young mother, with breasts full of nourishing milk. As personifications of the sap that pervades living plants, they are auspicious markers of life and abundance. These attractive figures, who embody the purifying water essential for life, symbolically cleanse visitors as they enter the sacred space. On both sides of this large bracket they grasp the branch of an ashoka tree, which has clusters of flowers that are bright red in nature."
Amitabha,11th Century,Null,Sculpture,"This delicately crafted statue of Amitabha, the Buddha of Infinite Light, bears testimony to the flowering of Buddhist art under the Liao Empire established by the Khitans, a nomadic Mongolian people, after the Tang persecution of Buddhists in 845. The Liao rulers were devout Buddhists who commissioned substantial religious projects. Liao Buddhist artifacts reflecting close ties to the Tang traditions were likely executed by displaced or enslaved artisans as a result of the Khitan conquest of northern China."
Month of May: Scene of May Day Festival,18th Century,France,Tapestry,"Seated spectators and splendidly clothed ladies and gentlemen on horseback watch May Day festivities in this tapestry. In the middle distance, archers prepare to shoot at a bush and bird placed atop a maypole, while more spectators congregate in the receding landscape. A border of rolled acanthus leaves and flower garlands frames the scene. This scene is one of twelve so-called Months of Lucas tapestries, each depicting activities that coincide with a month of the year. The original “Months of Lucas” was a sixteenth-century Flemish tapestry set that was owned by the French monarchy and mistakenly attributed to Lucas van Leyden during the 1600s. To this day, they continue to be known as the “Months of Lucas.” This original set was burned in 1797 so their gold and silver metal threads could be used to replenish the depleted French coffers. Beginning in the 1600s, the popular Months of Lucas were reproduced in several different versions under various masters at the Gobelins Manufactory in Paris, the famous royal production center for French tapestries since Louis XIV (1638–1715). The lower right hand corner of this tapestry bears the signature of Michel Audran (1701–1771), director of the Gobelins high-warp loom workshop from 1732–71, who produced this tapestry for a private patron in addition to the other royal commissions of the set."

Illuminated Folio from a Gulistan (Rose Garden) of Sa'di (c. 1213–1291),15th Century,Iran,Manuscript,"The border scene is set in a magical forest bursting with blossoms. At the top, a winged lion chases a winged deer, who is caught in the bottom border. The imagery of a lion biting down on its prey dates from the Achaemenid period in Iran (550–330 BCE) and references the valor of the king. A fox scurries off to the right. The verse is written in the Persian language using nastaliq script. Sultan ‘Ali Mashadi was widely renowned for perfecting the nastaliq script, and his calligraphy was a model for many followers across the Islamic world."
Locket,18th Century,Null,Jewelry,"This locket may have once been an amulet containing prayers and talismans or a container for perfume or other cosmetic items. At the center, a young woman stands between two groupings of large red flowers. The connections between women and nature have ancient precedents in India, often communicating auspicious fertility. Luxury enamels like this were the hallmark of 18th-century Jaipur goldsmiths and jewelry makers. This locket was given to the museum by the Twentieth Century Club, a women’s community group founded in the early 1900s with satellites across the United States."
Costumed Dancers Performing in a Garden Tavern,18th Century,France,Drawing,"Gabriel de Saint-Aubin was known for his rapidly executed, sketchy style, often used to depict performances and social scenes. The exaggerated lifted legs of the dancers seen here imply a comic, theatrical style; no social dance during the 18th century would have permitted such pronounced gestures, especially for a woman. Both dancers wear jackets with irregular hemlines decorated with round bells similar to those found on jesters’ costumes. The lanterns and swags of flowers strung from trees and the small orchestra playing on the right suggest a guinguette, or outdoor tavern with a pleasure garden."
Susuki Grass,16th Century,Null,Painting,"Susuki grass has a seasonal association with autumn in the Japanese visual and literary tradition. It is one of the “Seven Flowers of Autumn,” along with bush clover, arrowroot, pink, patrinia, mistflower, and bellflower. This composition immerses the beholder in a field of grasses and golden bands of mist. The design may have served as a backdrop for poems brushed in calligraphy on decorated papers and attached to the surface of the screens."
Bacchanalian Relief,3rd Century,Null,Stone,"Grape vines create vignettes with scenes of drunken revelry on this architectural carving that once fit by joinery to other carved stone blocks at the base of a Buddhist monument. Bacchus himself, the Greco-Roman god of wine, may be the third figure from the left; bearded, portly, and inebriated, his garment slips as he collapses. Cupid and Aphrodite appear in the vignette on the right next to an amorous couple. On the side is a female nature divinity, grasping the branch of a tree, but unlike her counterparts from farther south in India, she is clothed in a long tunic, pants, and scarf associated with the dress of the Central Asian nomadic groups."
"The Brahman gives an account of his falling in love with the king of Babylon’s daughter to his friend, the magician, from a Tuti-nama (Tales of a Parrot): Thirty-fifth Night",16th Century,Null,Painting,"The figure in orange is a magician addressing a seated Brahman—a member of India’s Hindu priestly class—who has come to him for help. He and the princess of Babylon have fallen in love and want to be together, but she is sequestered in the palace harem. The magician transformed the Brahman into a woman, shown at left, walking toward the palace. This is an example of continuous narration, in which two scenes are depicted in the same picture plane. The garden with flowering trees in the background evokes the setting where the Brahman and the princess met and fell in love."
Spring Flowers,20th Century,United States,Print,
Julius Caesar,15th Century,Italy,Sculpture,"Renowned Roman general and statesman Julius Caesar (100–44 BCE) appears here as a political rather than military leader, worn by the burdens of office, with carefully described signs of aging. Mino probably used ancient coins from the collection of the Medici, Florence's ruling family, as his starting point for this sculpture. However, the complex carving, the clinging drapery, and the psychological intensity all characterize the inventiveness Renaissance artists brought to classical subject matter. In this case, Caesar offered an important model for leadership, masculinity, and composure. The garland is clearly by a different hand, but passages, such as the ribbons and flowers in low relief, correspond to details found in other decorative carvings from Mino's workshop. Initially, the limestone setting was probably put into a wall, perhaps in a lunette over the door, from which it was later removed. However, the relationship between the garland and the relief has not yet been clarified and is the subject of ongoing research."

Mirror Back with Great Goddess,5th - 6th Century,Null,Sculpture,"An important female deity commands the watery scene on the back of this mirror. The face, bordered by ear ornaments and partially hidden by a nose ornament, appears beneath a huge headdress with the fringed eyes and curled proboscis of an abstract butterfly. The deity rests on a shell-studded water band and two adoring humans offer flowers or incense in a bag. Mirrors served as costume ornaments and perhaps were used in rituals to divine the unknown."

"Zulaykha in her palace and as an elderly woman with Joseph (recto), from a Panj Ganj (Five Treasures) of Abd al- Rahman Jami (Persian, 1414–1492)",17th Century,India,Painting,"The golden pot of white narcissus flowers at the bottom center of the painting signals that Zulaykha, leaning on her staff to the left, will imminently have her youth and beauty restored. In this Persian retelling of the Old Testament account from the Bible, Zulaykha lusted after Joseph, even though she was already married to Potiphar. Joseph, with the golden halo, resisted her advances until she became a widow and retained his youth, because of his extreme virtue. Above, Zulaykha as a young woman waits for Joseph in her house where murals of them as a happy couple are painted on the walls."
The Sunflower Arch,20th Century,United States,Drawing,"At the time he made this drawing, Burchfield had begun to develop a personal symbolic language, which he called “Conventions for Abstract Thoughts.” Using simple forms, such as the arched shape of the flowers seen here, he aimed to communicate universal emotions—in this case, “Mute Sorrow.” Burchfield saw a connection between this mood and sunflowers, which were among his favorite subjects. He often depicted them anthropomorphically, suggesting either open eyes or, as here, slumped human forms—as he described, “giv[ing] a sense of pre-autumnal melancholy in early September.”"
Autumn Flowers,20th Century,United States,Print,
Plum Blossoms and Peonies,18th Century,China,Painting,"One of the so-called Yangzhou Eccentrics (a group of painters who lived in Yangzhou and were known for their unorthodox art and lifestyle), Gao Fenghan depicts China’s two most loved flowers in full bloom—the “cold beauty,” or plum blossom, in the first section, and the “king of flowers,” or peony, in the second section. Painted in 1741, the year when Gao decided to leave the south and return home to Shandong province in eastern China, this work was likely a token of farewell. His casual brushwork may indicate his mental and physical struggle at the time. After having crippled his right hand in 1737, Gao used his left hand to paint and achieved a crudeness and eccentric style unattainable before."
"Rainbow Love Mountain Ranch, New Mexico",21st Century,United States,Print,"This print exemplifies Polly Apfelbaum’s interest in bright, saturated colors and repeated patterns. The artist finds inspiration in popular culture, using simple forms that draw from a wide range of sources—here, typographical characters called dingbats. The work’s title refers to a road sign that Apfelbaum repeatedly passed while she was working at the Tamarind Institute, a lithographic print shop in New Mexico. There, she used a rainbow roll—an ink roller with multiple blended colors—to produce the print’s vivid tonality."

They protested at Thiaroye; some were killed and many imprisoned. That revolt sparked a nationalist movement in Senegal that eventually liberated the country from French colonial rule."

"Portrait of Anne Law (née Towry), 1st Lady Ellenborough",19th Century,England,Portrait Miniature,"John Linnell was born and lived much of his young adulthood in Bloomsbury, where his father, James, made picture frames and restored paintings. As a boy the artist trained briefly with Benjamin West (1738–1820) and John Varley (1778–1842) before becoming a student at the Royal Academy from 1805 to 1812. Though primarily known for his landscapes, Linnell was also a prolific portraitist and executed miniatures during the first two decades of his career, learning the medium from his neighbor James Holmes (1770–1860). According to an early biographer, Linnell began painting miniatures around 1818 with a portrait of his wife. By 1823 he had executed a number of miniature commissions from aristocratic patrons, including Princess Sophia, facilitated by the praise of the society maven Lady Stafford. He painted his last known miniature on ivory in 1832. During the approximately fifteen years that the artist painted miniatures, he consistently charged between 10 and 50 guineas for a portrait. These fees corresponded less to the size of the ivory than to the degree of finish and elaboration of the composition.In this portrait Anne Law (née Towry), 1st Lady Ellenborough (c. 1769–1843), is depicted half length. She wears a high-waisted white dress of translucent fabric through which a hint of blue appears and around which she wears a black belt. A devant de corsage (stomacher, or bodice brooch) is worn at her décolletage, extending to the belt. Its gold framework contains at least twelve semiprecious stones colored blue, red, aquamarine, pink, and brown. A gold brooch with a large blue stone is pinned to the cloak at her right shoulder. She also wears a twisted multistrand pearl necklace, matching pearl pendant earrings, and two gold rings on her left ring finger. A dark gray-green shawl with red reverse, gold border, and red fringe is draped over her shoulders and arms. She holds a closed fan in her left hand and stands against a brown background featuring a green and auburn striped curtain in the upper left corner. The sitter’s fair hair is dressed in ringlets that fall at her neck. The miniature is housed in a standing gilt metal and red velvet frame that dates from the same period."

Bowl,17th Century,Null,Ceramics,"A long-legged bird, possibly a crane, is surrounded by flowers on the inside of the bowl. The rim is encircled by a band of undulating stems and flowers in red, deep blue, turquoise-green, white, and dull green-gray. The exterior features only the crackle glaze."
Sutra Container,12th Century,Null,Metalwork,"This is a portable container once used to preserve a miniature Buddhist sacred text. Created by hammering the reverse, high-relief designs on both the front and back of the case depict a peaceful pond where young boys are holding giant lotus flowers in their hands, and a pair of mandarin ducks are swimming. Probably the playful boys represent newly reborn souls in the Pure Land."
Small Dish with Flowers,17th Century,Null,Ceramics,
Fish and Rocks,17th Century,China,Painting,"Bada Shanren, also called Zhu Da, a 17th-century painter who rejected conventions in favor of an individual, personal expression, is known for his unorthodox compositions of fish, flowers, birds, and rocks. Fish in his paintings are often looking upward toward heaven, swimming in a pond of undefined space. As a member of the Ming imperial family, Zhu Da lost his princely status and hid in a monastery when the Manchus, foreigners from the north, established the Qing dynasty in 1644. This scroll may have some autobiographical meaning, representing fish as leftover subjects (yimin) who lived in a void, having lost their roles in life after the fall of the dynasty."
Potalaka Guanyin,10th Century,Null,Sculpture,"This portable figure of Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion who vowed to stay on earth to help human beings, is carved of precious sandalwood. It is lavishly covered with garlands of flowers that retain traces of the original red paint. The small sculpture may have been used in a private devotional context."
Cap,19th Century,Null,Garment,"Historically in India, head coverings were worn in outdoor and formal contexts and can signal age, allegiance, and status among Indian men and boys. A low round cap such as this was worn primarily by the well-educated aristocratic boys in the king’s circle. The painstaking process of creating the ornament involved wrapping gilt-silver wire of various dimensions around a silk thread core to create a textured appearance for the flowers and vines."

Avalokitesvara Padmapani:  Bodhisattva of Mercy Bearing a Lotus,11th Century,Null,Sculpture,"Venerated by Buddhists across the world as the perfect embodiment of compassion for all beings, this bodhisattva-a being only one stage away from complete enlightenment-holds his right hand out gently in the gesture of gift-giving. In his left hand, he once grasped the stem of a lotus flower that blossoms over his left shoulder, indicative of the abundant benefits that result from acts of loving kindness. All bodhisattvas wear royal garments and jewels, in reference to the historical Buddha’s early life as a prince, prior to his achievement of enlightenment through meditations in the forest. In the center of his crown is the tiny seated image of the meditating Buddha Amitabha that identifies this figure as Avalokitesvara specifically. Nepalese bronzes of the 11th century are solid cast and have an exceptionally high copper content in the alloy that makes the bronze difficult to manage during fabrication. The color achieved by the extra copper creates a distinctive warmth and softness in the sculpture. The flexed toes of the right foot and the swinging to one side of the gathered ends of his garment impart a sense of dynamism to his ongoing act of giving. His facial expression is sweet and placid but sharp, as though he is keenly aware of the sufferings of the world."
"Female Figure, Probably a Nature Divinity (Yakshi)",1st Century BCE,Null,Sculpture,"This powerful female figure, softly modeled with full volumes, is heavily adorned with jewels and flowers. In her right hand she grasps a fruit and her left rests on her hip.

One features female musicians, the other has two chariots, each drawn by a pair of galloping horses. Bulls, birds, and flowers fill the background spaces. This cup is from a group found in an area with close links to Indo-Greek kingdoms, and the chariots and framing motifs reveal knowledge of Hellenistic art."
Fragment of a Border with Abstract Pattern,16th Century,Null,Lace,"The dark yellow ground of the unbleached linen allows for the pattern, worked in bleached linen in the buratto technique, to stand out.

Garden for Solitary Enjoyment,16th Century,China,Painting,"Garden of Solitary Enjoyment refers to a site built in 1073 by the statesman Sima Guang (1019–1086) after he had retired to Luoyang, Henan province. Every spring, visitors would flock to his garden. Each of its seven structures references a historic figure. Sima wrote: I channel streams [like Du Mu], to water flowers [like Bai Juyi], or trim bamboo [like Wang Huizhi]. . . . I know of no joy between heaven and earth that could take its place. Qiu Ying’s painting, created after an 11th-century version of the same theme, must have appealed to garden owners of the Ming dynasty, since it became the template for numerous Suzhou workshop copies"

A female figure standing in a landscape holding a four-stringed “khuuchir” and a lotus,16th Century,Null,Painting,"Standing over flowering sprigs, holding a lotus like a scepter, the figure seems to magically impart fertility to a desert. In pan-Indian religious iconography (system of visual symbols that identify a figure), the lotus is held by the goddess of good fortune, prosperity, and abundance, who is frequently associated with ideal kingship. The stringed instrument recalls the Indian goddess of learning and music, but here it is of a Mongolian type, as is the feather in her crown. Her garments are reminiscent of those worn by biblical and classical figures in European engravings. This painting combines Indian, European, and Mongolian references."
Column Base,10th Century,Null,Sculpture,"This base comes from the palatial city of Madinat al-Zahra near Cordoba (Spain) which was begun by caliph Abd al-Rahman III (r. 912–61) around 936.

Plantae Selectae:  No. 37 - Yucca,18th Century,Germany,Print,"A major problem in horticulture was the lack of a consistent system of classification. The first successful attempt to establish a common nomenclature was in 1724 when 20 London nurserymen published a list of all plants grown in their nurseries. Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus’s Systema Naturae was published in 1735; it classified 7,700 plants by their botanic structure and gave them universally applicable two-part Latin names. From then on artists had to combine scientific accuracy with artistic skill. Many of Ehret’s flower portraits were copied by printmakers and published in the great botanical iconographies of his day. His patron Dr. Christoph Jakob Trew engaged the Haids, a distinguished family of Nuremberg etchers, to translate Ehret’s crisp, vigorously drawn paintings into printed illustrations."
Brush with Carved Design,16th - 17th Century,Null,Wood,"In China, access to political power was granted to those who passed the civil service examinations, a system that offered official service only at a high level of education. Chinese literati-officials, whose daily routine involved administrative work in an office, enjoyed precious objects on their writing desks that offered distraction and demonstrated good taste. By the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties, these utensils of the literati studio became also collectibles and were treasured as artworks.A brush, like this one, was essential for both administrative tasks and for artistic creation. The bamboo brush handle and cap were carved in shallow relief with branches, leaves, birds, and flowers. The brush tip was made from fine white animal hairs."
Hanging fragment with boar head,7th - 8th Century,Null,Textile,"This fragment preserves parts of two distinct designs. In the lower section, a boar's head is framed by a pearl roundel; to left and right are fragments of two other roundels, and in the spandrels are segments of stylized flowers. In the field above are four feet of what must have been a rather large-scale horse standing in a meadow of flowers of which only fragments remain. A fifth hoof, turned in the opposite direction, indicates that originally the composition included a pair of horses addorsed. A double row of pearls occupies the spaces beneath the horses' feet, and a narrow plain band separates this field from the one below."
Plaque,16th - 17th Century,Null,Sculpture,"Craftsmen modeled brass plaques like this in wax before casting them with hot metal. Molds pushed out figures’ general shapes, then details—such as this warrior’s staff and court sword (ẹbẹn)—were added by hand. Reflecting Benin’s global connections, the incised flowers may have Islamic or European origins. Called ebe-amẹn (river leaves) they are identified with Olókun, god of the waters. The interlaced side motifs may connect several early plaques also linked by topic and style. The palace plaques were in storage before the 1897 Siege of Benin. Recently, an art historian virtually reconstructed their former display in the palace based on their dimensions and imagery."

A Barber Cleaning the Ear of a Courtesan,19th Century,India,Print,"Popular Kalighat paintings were made into woodcuts for mass printing and distribution. This image reveals the lifestyle of a new middle class of Indians who prospered under British rule. Holding a fancy hookah for pleasurable smoking, draped with jewels, wearing a glamorous sari, and with a flower tucked in her hair, she has the luxury of going to a barber to have her ears cleaned. The age of mechanical reproduction made a heavy impact on the new Indian middle class during the last decades of the 1800s. British magazines and periodicals were fashionable among Indian households, and they served to shape their taste for British and Western styles and commodities. Cheaper prints such as this woodcut were made for more popular distribution. They spoke to aspirations or observations by a broader, less privileged community."
Prunus Vase (Meiping) with Blossoming Lotus,15th Century,Null,Ceramics,"According to 11th-century poet Zhou Dunyi, “all people like peonies, but I alone like the lotus because it emerges from the mud unstained.” The lotus is a symbol of purity and popular among Chinese literati and in Buddhism. This vase shows lotus flowers rising from the water’s surface depicted in elegant yet simple ripples. Made in a kiln at Jingdezhen in southern China, this vase is an example of the fahua technique—decoration with raised outlines produced by squeezing clay from a tube onto the vase’s surface. Colors are applied to fill the outlines before firing."
Pair of Qingbai Ware Bowls with Covers,12th - 13th Century,Null,Ceramics,"While dark-glazed ceramics resemble black lacquer ware, and celadons were often compared to green jade, white or bluish-white glazed stoneware imitates silver. Here, broad silver bands around the bowls’ rims accentuate their precious appearance. The incised petals are inspired by lotus flowers and the domed covers by their circular leaves. The lotus motif often indicates the use of an object in a Buddhist context, in which it is a symbol of purity as its flowers emerge unsullied from the mud of lakes and ponds. Alternatively, these bowls may have been used to hold food at banquets."
"The soldier receives a garland of roses from his wife which will remain fresh as long as she is faithful, from a Tuti-nama (Tales of a Parrot): Fourth Night",16th Century,Null,Painting,"Upon his departure, a warrior’s wife gives him roses that stay fresh as long as she remains faithful in his absence. This story reveals a connection between virtue and nature: the flowers remain fresh because of her loyalty.The stories in the Tuti-nama reveal the interconnectedness of Indian, Persian, and Central Asian populations. The Persian retellings of Sanskrit tales found in this manuscript were completed in 1330 by the learned Central Asian Sufi author Ziya’ al-din Nakshabi working in Delhi, the capital of India. Indian and Persian artists worked together to illustrate this copy for the Mughal emperor Akbar."

Column Capital,10th Century,Null,Sculpture,"This capital comes from the palatial city of Madinat al-Zahra near Cordoba (Spain) which was begun by caliph Abd al-Rahman III (r. 912–61) around 936. Large parts of the Iberian Peninsula were then under Islamic rule and experienced a cultural flowering. The city, destroyed already in 1010, was the most magnificent palace complex in Europe at the time."

Farmer's Wife,20th Century,United States,Print,"Working in the mid-20th century through the 1980s, the social-realist painter Robert Gwathmey's work mingles memories of his pleasant childhood in the South with his observations of the physical and financial hardships of primarily Black, poor Southern farm workers as an adult. Gwathmey's lens—that of a white man living in New York City and educated in Europe—brought a modernist sensibility to scenes that focused on individual figures or family groups. In Farmer's Wife, he employed expressive distortion of the human figure and a reduction and simplification of forms derived from European Modernism, using flat areas of color in a repetitive and simplified color palette that draws connections between the sitter's skin and dress, the flower bouquet, and the table. The artful arrangement of flowers and the table, with its heart-shaped decoration, reveal the sitter's industry and resilience, just as her hands and face suggest a lifetime of hard work. Gwathmey said of the image that it ""is my response to a lady of character who has borne the scars of outrageous circumstance and has refused to be destroyed."""
Irises,18th Century,Japan,Painting,"The subject of this painting comes from a 10th-century text. It tells of a young nobleman’s journey into the lonely countryside, far from the capital city of Heian-kyō (Kyoto). There he came upon a small stream, the banks of which were covered with blooming irises, on which the artist has chosen to focus our attention. While viewing the beautiful flowers the nobleman composed a poem:I have a beloved wife, Familiar as the skirt of a well-worn robe, And so this distant journeying Fills my heart with grief."
Apothecary's Bottle,17th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This white porcelain bottle is decorated with cobalt blue birds and flowers. While inspired by functional apothecary jars used in medieval pharmacies, this bottle was likely decorative. Its underside has the initials IC, which are almost certainly those of Johannes Camphuys (1634-1695), who was in charge of the Dutch East India Company’s operations in Deshima in 1671. During the Edo period, the Japanese government relegated Dutch traders to the man-made island of Deshima in Nagasaki harbor as a means of preventing European influence on the native population."

Brünnhilde in Twilight of the Gods,19th Century,France,Print,"This print shows Odilon Redon’s passion for the music of 19th-century German composer Richard Wagner. Brünnhilde is a main character in the final chapter of Wagner’s The Ring of the Nibelung, an epic four-part operatic piece composed over several decades. Created after Redon’s extensive experimentation with and mastery of lithography, the print reveals the medium’s similarity to drawing in the range of marks used to sketch its subject. Redon delicately outlined flowers in the background and crosshatched to highlight Brünnhilde’s face before turning his crayon on its side to darken her hair and chest."
Wheel-Lock Rifle,17th Century,Null,Arms and Armor,"Made originally as a petronel pistol, this firearm seems to have been refitted with a new stock sometime during the 17th century to convert it into a rifle, most likely for a child's use."

Pendant with Matsya (fish incarnation of Vishnu) defeating Hayagriva,19th Century,Null,Jewelry,"Three emeralds and many pearls surround the central part of this pendant, which features a scene from the life of Matsya at the center. The fish incarnation of the preserver god Vishnu, Matsya appears in the middle, defeating the demon Hayagriva, who emerges from a shell, grasping him by the hair. Encircling the battle are plants, flowers, and designs indicative of ocean waves. The four-headed god Brahma also watches from the left side. Below the main scene, two smaller teardrop-shaped ornaments hang down. They feature scenes of predator birds, which may allude to the courtly falcon hunts of rulers."
Wine Pot with Incised Lotus Design,10th - 14th Century,Null,Ceramics,"As early as the seventh century, the practice of drinking tea and wine became an important part of elite culture in Korea. Elites of the Goryeo period commissioned a variety of types of utensils and vessels including this elegant wine pot with the incised image of lotus flowers, not only to make their drinking experience more exciting, but also to show their appreciation of nature."
Jar with Dragon Design,18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"A mythical creature believed to have the power to make rain, the dragon is a prominent symbol of rulers in premodern East Asia. In underglaze cobalt blue, a dragon on this jar is depicted flying through clouds to catch a flaming, wish-granting pearl called a cintamani. In the royal court, the shorter type of dragon jar was used to hold wine, the tall type, such as this one, was for holding a bouquet of flowers."
Writing Stand,18th Century,France,Ceramics,"The faience factory at Sinceny was an offshoot of that at Rouen. In style, Sinceny closely resembles later Rouen wares with polychrome decoration. The stylized flowers and insects which decorate this writing stand are entirely typical of Sinceny faience."

"Portrait of a kneeling holy man, from the Prince Salim Album",16th Century,India,Painting,"One of the few surviving works that appear to have been made by an artist brought from Iran by Akbar’s father, Humayun, shortly after his arrival in Mughal India, this page was mounted into the Prince Salim Album in his breakaway court in Allahabad. The flowing lyrical contour lines, penetrating expression, and soft yet wiry texture of the beard reveal the hand of a master. The verse written above and below the painting is a quotation from a poetic sermon of the Persian author Sana’i, who lived about 1100: If it were greed that led you to acquire learning, then be afraid, For at night, a thief with a torch can take away the choicest goods! The calligraphy suggests that the kneeling figure is a charlatan holy man who wears the blue robe of a Sufi mystic and acts with humility and piety for monetary gain rather than sincerity of devotion."
Plum Tree,18th Century,Japan,Painting,"Ogata Kōrin had to think through his design carefully to create these white plum blossoms and deliver their effect, as he used the reserve technique—where selected areas of the painting surface are left unpainted—to achieve it. He probably roughed in the tree before applying an ink wash to the entire silk surface, except where he intended to place the flowers. He likely then returned to articulate the petals and, in some cases, the pistils and stamens. The composition shows the tree twisting out of view, only to return with a branch of new growth jabbing forth from an old, broken limb, thereby heightening the visual impact of the blossoms."
Double-Faced Crossbar from a Railing: Female Figure (verso),2nd Century BCE,Null,Sculpture,"The bust of a female figure in the center of the lotus medallion grasps a cluster of round flowers, probably kadamba, in her right hand. An embroidered coif crisscrosses over her head, and a lotus-shaped medallion ornaments her brow. Like a yakshi, or nature divinity, she embodies life-giving forces of nature."

The Lovers,15th Century,Germany,Print,"In this image, a man and woman sit facing one
another; the woman casts her eyes down shyly
as the man makes a tender touch, an invitation
to love. This artist pared down a garden of love
to an arbor with a low fence, a vase of flowers,
and a basin of water holding a jug of wine and
cup. The love displayed in the garden is chaste,
as intended. This is apparent by the wine in
the water bath, suggesting cooled desire; the
carnations in the vase, symbols of virginity;
and the woman’s small dog, a sign of fidelity."
Twelve Months of Flowers:  July,18th Century,England,Print,
Lily and Butterflies,14th Century,China,Painting,"The bird is represented in pale ink, probably sketched in before the darker ink was used to finish the rock. Like the butterfly and moth above, his tail feathers echo the bamboo as well as the leaves and petals of the flowers. The Chinese wagtail can connote brotherly love. The daylily was used for various pharmaceutical purposes, especially for deadening pain in childbirth. It was also considered efficacious in relieving grief and aiding in the production of sons. The lily is in fact the real subject of this painting: it is the common symbol for motherly love. Hence, the lingering of the butterfly over a lily can signify a son's love, devotion, and yearning for his mother—the refuge from worldly woes."
Five Pine Trees,18th Century,China,Painting,"Li Shan was born into a family of scholars and officials in Yangzhou. The wealth and status of Li's family assured him an educational and cultural advantage, including his appointment at court. The subjects Li Shan chose to paint—orchids, bamboo, pines, and flowers—reflected his literati background. Five Pine Trees, painted late in his career, is an unconventional work. Rather than having focused on a realistic treatment of the subject, Li created the trees with an interplay of richly modulated strokes, while he utilized a semicursive script among the branches to illustrate the kinship between painting and calligraphy."
Autumn Evening with Full Moon on Musashino Plain,17th Century,Null,Painting,"Tall grasses and autumn flowers reach out of thick green undergrowth in this depiction of the plain of Musashi, a site famous from classical Japanese poetry. A silver disc, now tarnished, represents the full moon. Flecks of cut-gold foil in the sky evoke the day’s passage into night. Once a wilderness with a vast horizon, Musashi is now densely populated."

"Royal Reception in a Landscape, left folio from the double frontispiece of a Shahnama (Book of Kings) of Firdausi (Persian, about 940–1019 or 1025)",15th Century,Null,Manuscript,"The royal feast is set in a green landscape dotted with flowers and blossoming bushes against a gold sky with wisps of blue and white clouds. The group of figures in the upper left includes a falconer, horses, attendants, and two hunting cheetahs, while servers transport food and drink in gold and ceramic vessels, some presumably Chinese blue and white porcelain. Possibly this banquet was offered after a courtly hunt, a prestigious symbol of power and wealth. Among the groups of men sitting on elaborate carpets are three Chinese officials, identifiable by their black hats, kneeling together on the ground. Although their presence indicates the presence of foreign cultures within the Timurid court, the painting also reveals that not all are welcome to the feast; in the bottom half of the page a guard wields a stick to drive a group of men out of the garden."
Dish with Sweet Osmanthus and Cloud,17th - 18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"The dish is an example of the finest type of early Japanese porcelain, Nabeshima-type Hizen ware. It is decorated with sweet osmanthus, or fragrant olive tree, with iron-red flowers and green and yellow enamels on the leaves. A band of misty clouds in underglaze blue completes the composition. The osmanthus tree was imported from China to southern Japan."
Border with Floral Motifs,19th Century,Null,Lace,"A tendril motif is a recurring pattern in needle lace. The frequent use of the motif, adapted in lace from different centuries and regions, suggests that it was found in a pattern book. Here, the pattern is unusually ornate with additional swirling and flowering motifs."

Krishna with Cow 2,20th Century,India,Painting,"Inspired by the bold style of Kalighat paintings, Jamini Roy created paintings using indigenous materials, often with multiple versions of the same subject. Here the infant Krishna crawls with a butter ball in one hand. The cow, flowers, and leaves set the rural bucolic environment of his youth."
Maharao Ram Singh II of Kota (r. 1828–66) Worships Brij Nathji as the Bridegroom,19th Century,Null,Painting,"Shri Nathji, the dark stone sculpture carved in high relief with its monolithic stele is here shown sumptuously dressed, wearing the square headdress of a bridegroom. His long tuft of hair, braided with flowers, swings to one side, while the end of his stole swings to the other, imparting joyous vitality and dynamism."
"Album of Miscellaneous Subjects, Leaf 6",17th Century,China,Painting,"Leaf 6 Zhou Yi's colophon reads: The bright moon emerges through the willow, The fragrance of flowers is already difficult to retain. Listening above these tall branches, I sense that faraway in my native place autumn has arrived. Obstructed, all the diminished waters flow, Abruptly the sound of a lute wafts to and fro. A strong wind, unabated, blows among the willow branches."
Medallion,19th Century,Null,Jewelry,"Circular ornaments were worn as pendants, sewn onto textiles, or pinned into hair.

Bidri Hookah Bowl with Roses,17th Century,Null,Metalwork,"Hookah bowls were used for the enjoyment of tobacco or any other smoked substance during moments of relaxation. They were also aesthetic objects to be admired in elite gatherings of connoisseurs. The flowering rose bushes on this fine early example, made shortly after the introduction of tobacco-smoking in India, would have called to mind celebrated poetical works, such as the Gulistan (Rose Garden) of Sa'di (Persian, 1210–1291 or 1292)."
"A Lady with Attendant and a Pair of Deer: Probably Gujari Ragini of Dipak, from a Pahari Ragamala",18th Century,Null,Painting,"Two ladies, one clad in a transparent shawl and the other wearing a Mughal peshwaz, are flanked by a pair of deer under a flowering tree. The lady standing on a hexagonal stool is fondly caressing the deer while her attendant holds a vina, an Indian musical instrument. The scene is set against a solid mauve monochromatic background."
Trophy Cup and Cover,18th Century,England,Silver,"Silver fulfilled a prominent role in projecting wealth, status, power, and ritual in British life during the 1600s and 1700s. Elaborate forms such as this trophy, with its swags of flowers, neoclassical rosettes, acanthus spears, and acorn finial, not only represented wealth in its sheer silver weight but also provided royal and aristocratic owners a surface for displaying engraved coats of arms. Engraved on one side of this trophy cup can be found the arms of Robert Grosvenor (1767–1845), the first Marquess of Westminster, and Lady Eleanor Egerton (1770–1846), whom he married in 1794, a year after the trophy’s completion. The other side depicts preparations for a horserace, the most culturally significant leisure activity enjoyed by aristocratic families in the 1700s. Grosvenor owned a number of famous horses and was likely awarded this trophy following a successful race."
Ornament,19th Century,Null,Jewelry,"Circular ornaments were worn as pendants, sewn onto textiles, or pinned into hair. The decorative motif made of colorful gems depicting flowering plants was introduced during the reign of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (1628–58) and remained popular through the 1800s."
Meiping Vase with carved Dragon Motif,14th Century,Null,Ceramics,"A fierce coiling dragon chasing a pearl amid mist and clouds—a symbol of fertility and power—decorates this sturdy vase. Its shoulder is incised with a band of lotus flowers and the base features a border of lotus petals. Meiping, literally prunus vase, derives its name from being used to display a single floral spray, traditionally a branch of blossoming plum (or prunus), apricot, or cherry."
Chrysanthemums and Cabbage,15th Century,China,Painting,"On an autumn day in Beijing, Tao Cheng had a gathering with a group of scholar-officials and created two paintings in a spontaneous, casual style. The first depicts chrysanthemums, slender bamboo stalks, and a rock in monochrome ink. Tao applied light colors for the second painting that depicts cabbage. Tao deliberately placed the images on the first sections of the paper so that his honorable guests could add their poetic inscriptions inspired by his imagery. In the first section to the right, all seven poetic inscriptions refer to the beloved poet and recluse Tao Qian (also called Tao Yuanming, AD 365–427) who was particularly known for his profound love for chrysanthemum flowers. Most of the inscriptions in the second section express sympathy for the poor, since cabbage is the main ingredient in their humble food. Taken together, the poems and paintings allude to the life and responsibilities of the scholar-official: the importance of both an upright character and a concern for the poor citizens in order to achieve good government."
Orchid Blossoms,19th Century,United States,Painting,"In 1863 Heade took the first of three trips to South America, with an amateur naturalist, the Reverend C. J. Fletcher, to do studies for a projected (though never published) book on hummingbirds. As an outgrowth of that experience, Heade made a large number of paintings of birds and flowers, especially orchids, in a tropical setting. In this way he combined his main interests of still life and landscape--a union of themes he maintained in his work into the 20th century. The paintings are characterized by meticulous and precise rendering of detail and high-keyed luminescent color."
Pipa (Loquats),19th Century,China,Painting,"The loquat is a plant native to China that produces a juicy, yellow fruit in early summer. The artist may have intentionally extended the branches beyond the paper to emphasize the abundance of fruit. Xugu’s subjects of flowers, goldfish, and loquats express wishes for abundance and wealth, and must have appealed to his patrons.Xugu gave up his career as a military official during the Taiping rebellion (1850–64) and became an itinerant monk who painted for a living. He spent the later years of his life in Shanghai and his fame as an artist is associated with that city."
Cutting from an Antiphonary:  Initial A[spiciens a longe]: The Tree of Jesse,12th Century,Null,Manuscript,"This complex initial ""A"" is formed of meandering plant tendrils, neatly and symmetrically placed at the center of a succession of square frames to which the letter is securely attached above and below. The whole forms a Tree of Jesse showing Christ's ancestors beginning with King David (bottom). The text would have begun, ""Long have I been watching...."" These are the words of Isaiah, who foresaw the coming of Christ. Isaiah's prophecies are the basis for the representations of the Tree of Jesse, often seen in medieval art."
Paintings after Ancient Masters,16th Century,China,Painting,"The twenty paintings in this double album by Chen Hongshou include landscapes, figures, and flowers. It also has one leaf featuring a woman, an often-used subject not found in the other albums from the latter part of his career. His late works are wonderful summations of Chen's peculiar and quirky art—archaistic, hyper-refined—but without accompanying shallowness or sentimentality.His figures and landscapes in the late albums are miniaturized, not unlike the small Chinese gardens, or the carefully selected small table rocks or old roots used for contemplation to see the world in miniature. This loss of scale is quite deliberate and reflects the psychological situation of a depressed class like the Ming loyalist officials and scholars, deprived of their integrity and honor, and forced to lead a diminished and restricted existence."
Well Head,15th Century,Null,Sculpture,A well head is an architectural element that protects the mouth of a well. This example is both decorative and functional. The durable pink limestone well head facilitated access to the water whose restorative nature is echoed in the flowers and vases that ornament its surface.
A Family of Tartars,19th Century,Null,Painting,"This painting depicts men of Turkic descent migrating into India from western Asia. No longer with the ambition to conquer, like the Turko-Mongol rulers Timur (d. 1405) and Babur (c. 1530), the first Mughal emperor, these migrants are seeking new lands in which to settle as immigrants. The highly detailed subjects are placed against a plain background, as if the figures were designed for objective study and categorization. Indian artists made works such as this for the British in India, who were interested in collecting accurate visual records of flora, fauna, and ethnic groups who inhabited the land they colonized in 1858."
Tiger Hunt of Raja Ram Singh II,19th Century,Null,Painting,"With the dramatic cliffs of Kotah as the backdrop, one massive tiger is shown at three rapidly successive moments in time. Having been lured out of the forest by the dead bull at the upper left, the king’s men drive the tiger to the riverbanks with drums, trumpets, arrows, and muskets. The king himself, Ram Singh II who ruled the small kingdom of Kotah from 1827 until 1866, is shown in the act of delivering the fatal shot from the prow of a boat, as the ladies and nobles of the court look on in admiration. The tiger sinks into the river, from where he will be retrieved and offered with all honor and ceremony to a religious leader who will see to it that the shakti, or divine creative energies embodied by the tiger, be translated into blessings and prosperity for the kingdom. This example of a ritual tiger hunt belongs to a genre known as Rajput painting, made at the courts of kingdoms in Rajasthan that were under the aegis of the Mughal empire. The establishment of court painting workshops in the Rajput kingdoms was inspired by the imperial Mughal model, but each court developed its own distinctive style."
Vase,20th Century,France,Ceramics,"The shape of this vase, with its globular body and long neck, is influenced by the form of Chinese porcelain vases intended to hold singular flowers or branches. Delicate pink poppies with green and gold leaves decorate the vase."
Melon-shaped Ewer with Incised Peony Design,13th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This melon-shaped pitcher is adorned with a delicate drawing that renders chrysanthemum buds with full blossoms in white and black inlays. In Korea, chrysanthemum flowers and leaves were made into both tea and wine. Chrysanthemum wine was enjoyed during the the Double Nine Festival (the ninth day of the ninth month in the lunar calendar) when praying for longevity."
Bifolio from a Book of Hours: Initial V with Floral Border (recto); Text (verso),15th Century,Null,Manuscript,"The word dirge, today meaning a mournful hymn for funerals, comes from the opening Latin in the Office of the Dead, seen just after the decorative letter A at upper left. During the Middle Ages, dirge became the shortened way to refer to the Office of the Dead. Although primarily recited at funerals, the office was also prayed at home as a reminder of mortality and a protection against sudden death. Surrounding the text, which contains Psalm 5, is a border decoration of acanthus leaves, believed to grow in paradise, as well as a parrot, a squirrel, a beetle, and flowers."
"Cloth with Unicorns, Dragons, Other Animals, and Floral Patterns",19th Century,Null,Lace,"Scattered throughout this textile are depictions of both real and imaginary animals: unicorns and dragons exist alongside lions, stags, and an assortment of birds. There are also identifiable plants, flowers, and fruits as well as simply decorative or fictional ones. The maker, whose initials CM appear between the unicorns, perhaps chose to mix fantastical motifs with natural ones to create a more captivating spectacle. This large textile was perhaps meant for use as a table cover."
"Tigers Chasing Deer, with Dragon",11th - 12th Century,Null,Textile,"The design of this Central Asian tapestry is a synthesis of Western and Chinese elements. Bands of pearls and split palmettes and the deer with mushroom-shaped antlers originated in Iran and Sogdiana but migrated to China during the Tang dynasty (618-907). Although these motifs disappeared from Chinese art after the fall of the Tang, they survived in Central Asia for centuries. The dragon is Chinese in origin, but has a Central Asian form (particularly its extended snout). Also characteristic of Central Asia are the placement of the dragon among flowers, the liveliness of the animals, the use of floral sprays of varying scale and species, and the brilliant colors. The combination of unrelated patterns (bands of tigers chasing deer next to the dragon among flowers) probably evolved from the ancient practice of applying borders to garments with contrasting designs."

"Varaha, Boar Incarnation of Vishnu",8th - 9th Century,Null,Stone,"In the myth of Vishnu's boar incarnation, or avatar, a demon hid the earth at the bottom of the primordial ocean. The god took the form of a boar (varaha) and rescued her. Even with his legs missing, this sculpture conveys the powerful lunge of his body as he raises the earth to safety. Personified as the goddess Bhu, one of Vishnu's two wives, she does not appear helpless; perched on his raised elbow, she returns his adoring gaze. This image was popular among kings of India, who appear to have appropriated it as a metaphor for their own conquest over new territories, as though the king, like Vishnu, rescued the land and raised it to safety and prosperity."
Blanket Strip,20th Century,Null,Leather,"The animal-hide robes basic to Plains attire were often ornamented with quilled or beaded strips, which also were stitched to the blankets that replaced robes. This beaded example carries the cross-in-a-circle motif that symbolizes the world, the four directions, and the sacred center, concepts central to Plains worldviews. In the 1932 words of Black Elk, the Oglala Lakota (Sioux) holy man, “[T]he power of the world always works in circles. . . . The flowering tree was at the center of the hoop, and the circle of the four quarters nourished it. . . . Everything the power of the world does is done in a circle.”"
"The royal priest Shatananda confirms that the four princesses of Mithila should marry the sons of King Dasharatha, from Chapter 70 of the Bala Kanda (Book of Childhood), folio 13 from a “Shangri” Ramayana (Rama’s Journey)",17th - 18th Century,Null,Painting,"In front of their hut, a priest and his wife announce to the four princesses of Mithila that they are to marry the princes of Ayodhya. Sita, who will become the wife of the hero Rama, is probably the figure wearing the white flowered garment, since she stands out the most against the saturated ochre background. Had the painting been finished, gold would have been applied to the jewelry and other accouterments. Lacking in spatial depth and ground plane, the scene is set and dramatized by means of bold color, overlapping textures, expressive gestures, and intense gazes."

Some More,20th Century,United States,Painting,"During the final quarter century of her career, Joan Mitchell made a significant number of multipanel paintings, including Some More, comprising three equal-sized canvases whose composition bridges their shared edges. While the painting’s color and texture connote nature—such as a bed of flowers or shimmering sunlight—its rhythmic interaction of brushwork also suggests a source in music. In fact, Mitchell loved listening to opera while working in her studio during this period."
Embroidered head scarf,19th Century,Null,Embroidery,The edges of this headscarf are embroidered with landscape: a mosque alternates with a Turkish tent with a flowering plant between. In each corner is a medallion formed by a flowering plant surrounding a Turkish tent.
Pair of Vases,18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This spectacular vase, one of a pair in the collection, depicts flowering and fruiting peach trees to convey an auspicious message of affluence and long life. Developments in enamel technology led to new possibilities in polychrome decoration of Qing imperial porcelains. Pinks appeared, lending their name to the new palette of overglaze colors (famille rose), and the addition of opaque white allowed painters to vary the value of pigments, enhancing the painterly quality of porcelain decoration."

Painting of One Hundred Themes,19th Century,Null,Painting,"The front of this screen features an assortment of subjects: birds and flowers, landscapes, and scenes of everyday life, mostly in monochromatic ink with light colors. The screen’s reverse side conveys a number of classical poems about the fleeting beauty of the four seasons. Traditionally, only one side of a folding screen bears painted or embroidered images, since these were used as a background furnishing. In Korean houses by the 1800s and early 1900s, however, two-sided folding screens became noticeably popular, possibly inspired by Japanese double-sided folding screens, which mainly served as room dividers in Japanese households."
Vase Feuille d'Eau,19th Century,France,Ceramics,"Feuille d'Eau means ""waterleaf"" and refers to the name given to the shape of this vase at the Sèvres factory. In English, waterleaf is the common name for a plant with bell-shaped flowers. The term is also applied to a stylized plant motif used in Graeco-Roman ornament. This vase was exhibited by the Sèvres firm at the International Exhibition held in London in 1862."
Fragment of a Bed Curtain,18th Century,Null,Embroidery,"This fragment of a bed curtain is covered with flowering vase forms with fantastic flowers and leaves. Can you find the birds, animals and snakes scattered among the foliage?"
Alms Bowl,10th Century,Null,Metalwork,"Alms bowls used by Buddhist monks to receive donations have traditionally been made of iron or wood. This bowl, made of gilt bronze and decorated with incised designs of birds and flowers in roundels as well as butterflies, is instead a luxury item likely meant for a Buddhist altar, where it would have contained offerings for a Buddhist deity."
String for Men's Hat,19th Century,Null,Jewelry,"Made of either agarwood or red sandalwood, this bead string was once attached to a man's hat called a gat. Each bead bears an inscribed image of fish, birds, frogs, flowers, a boy holding a peach, and some characters of auspicious meanings such as longevity and good fortune."
"Embroidery from a Cloud Collar: Ocean, Rocks, and Peonies",14th Century,Null,Embroidery,"Against a deep blue satin ground, a peony tree emerges from an undulating sea. This embroidery was made using the needle looping technique, in which rows of detached loops are worked over silvered paper, attaching the ground only along the contours of the design. The design is filled with auspicious symbols, including the peony symbolizing wealth and honor, and the rock (shoushi 壽石) symbolizing longevity. There are small Buddhist symbols among the flowers, including the wheel of the law, a pair of conch shells representing the sounds of the Buddha’s teachings, and a swastika, an auspicious symbol signifying good fortune introduced into China from India with Buddhism."

"Varaha, Boar Incarnation of Vishnu",8th - 9th Century,Null,Stone,"In the myth of Vishnu's boar incarnation, or avatar, a demon hid the earth at the bottom of the primordial ocean. The god took the form of a boar (varaha) and rescued her. Even with his legs missing, this sculpture conveys the powerful lunge of his body as he raises the earth to safety. Personified as the goddess Bhu, one of Vishnu's two wives, she does not appear helpless; perched on his raised elbow, she returns his adoring gaze. This image was popular among kings of India, who appear to have appropriated it as a metaphor for their own conquest over new territories, as though the king, like Vishnu, rescued the land and raised it to safety and prosperity."
Millefleurs Tapestry with Medici Coat of Arms,16th Century,Null,Tapestry,"Many identifiable flowering plants provide the French name, millefleur, for this pattern, which became fashionable around 1450. Each plant may have symbolized either religion, courtship, or morals. However, many millefleur tapestries, made for about 100 years, were probably not symbolic. Large quantities were woven only with flowers; some also incorporated birds and animals or, in this case, coats of arms. Here, the original coat of arms has been replaced by that of the Medicis, a prominent family in Renaissance Florence."

Young Woman Looking at a Pot of Pinks,18th Century,Japan,Print,"A girl steps onto a veranda after a bath to look at a pot of pinks. A warm breeze stirs the poem-strip tied to the windbell above her. Irises bloom in the pool in the background. The print has been identified as the summer subject in a set of four flowers representing each season and is considered to be one of Harunobu’s most enchanting designs. One of the most celebrated and productive of all ukiyo-e artists, Harunobu is widely recognized as the first Japanese printmaker to create designs by printing each color in the image with a different block. These prints came to be known as nishiki-e, or brocade pictures, suggesting their resemblance to the gorgeous brocades worn at the time. The embossing on the waves in the stream and on the flowers was created by using unpigmented blocks during the printing process."
Cuff with Floral Vines,19th Century,Null,Lace,"In this lace cuff (one of a set, see 1936.225), scrolling vines with budding flowers emerge from a tied bow, creating a stylized bouquet. A scrolling vine with budding vegetation or a tendril motif is a recurring pattern in needle lace. The frequent use of the motif, adapted in lace from different centuries and regions, suggests that it was found in a pattern book."

The frequent use of the motif, adapted in lace from different centuries and regions, suggests that it was found in a pattern book."
Blanket Strip,20th Century,Null,Leather,"The animal-hide robes basic to Plains attire were often ornamented with quilled or beaded strips, which also were stitched to the blankets that replaced robes. This beaded example carries the cross-in-a-circle motif that symbolizes the world, the four directions, and the sacred center, concepts central to Plains worldviews. In the 1932 words of Black Elk, the Oglala Lakota (Sioux) holy man, “[T]he power of the world always works in circles. . . . The flowering tree was at the center of the hoop, and the circle of the four quarters nourished it. . . . Everything the power of the world does is done in a circle.”"
Gourd Flask with Floral Scrolls,18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This large blue-and-white pilgrim–shaped vase was fashioned from fine kaolinic porcelain at the imperial kilns at Jingdezhen, Jiangxi province. The body of the vase is of quatrefoil shape merging into a highly similar shaped neck, flanked by two scroll handles. The base is of oval quatrefoil form. The vase is decorated with lotus and other flowers, leaves, and scrolling tendrils in brilliant underglaze cobalt blue beneath a pellucid glaze. The underfoot bears an imperial mark."
"Monk preaching to a disciple with a lay audience, folio 2 (recto) from a Parshvanatha Charitra (Life and Stories of Lord Parshva) of Bhavadeva-suri",13th Century,Null,Painting,"The scene of a senior monk teaching his disciple emphasizes the importance of oral transmission of stories and knowledge. Both wear the white robes of the Shvetambara sect, have whisk brooms for clearing the ground of living things, and hold shields in front of their mouths to prevent harm to insects that might fly in while they speak. Between them, on a tripod, rests a sacred manuscript with letters written on the side and flowers placed on top. Below, two women and two men, possibly the donors who paid for the production of the manuscript, press their hands together in veneration."

Plaque with Inlaid Peony and Chrysanthemum Design,13th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Celadons, spoons, seals, and bronze mirrors were the most common burial objects in tombs during the Goryeo period (918-1392). Furnishing tombs with an elaborate assemblage of objects was believed to honor and comfort the newly dead. This type of celadon tile, elegantly adorned with the image of flowers such as bloomed peonies and chrysanthemums, was used to embellish the interior of buildings."
Textile Fragment with the Annunciation,14th Century,Null,Textile,"The motif shown here depicts the Virgin Mary and the angel Gabriel in a repeating sequence. Both figures kneel above a bed of flowers while a dove representing the Holy Ghost hovers above. The ground of this luxury silk, woven with highlights of gold thread, is now a faded blue. Its original purpose is not clear, but it may have originally been part of an altar frontal or possibly an ecclesiastical cope, or cape."
A prince conversing with a woman while taking refreshments on a terrace (recto); Calligraphy (verso),18th Century,Null,Painting,"A princess pours liquor from a golden bottle into a tiny cup for a prince visiting the women’s quarters in a Mughal palace. The carpeted terrace overlooks a garden of flowering trees. The pair’s royal status is indicated by the attendants who hold the white cloth and peacock-feather whisks. Two other women bring jewels and a vial of perfume to be inspected and discussed by the royal connoisseurs. This is a setting where books, paintings, and poetry also would be enjoyed."
Meiping Vase with Carved Floral Sprays,10th - 13th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This magnificent plum vase (meiping) derives its name from being used to hold a branch from a flowering plum tree. Vases of this shape with a round shoulder and narrow opening originally served as wine containers. Kilns in southern China that produced this ware with a transparent bluish glaze were among the first that applied underglaze blue-and-white decoration, which became popular during the Yuan (1271–1368) and Ming (1368–1644) dynasties. These elegantly carved floral sprays on a monochromatic ground reflect the refined taste of the Song dynasty emperors."

"The snake, hidden in a basket of flowers, reveals himself to the Raja who has just sent away his wife, from a Tuti-nama (Tales of a Parrot): Forty-third Night",16th Century,Null,Painting,"A black cobra appears beside the raja’s bed, intending to poison him in revenge for his earlier cruelty. The raja, who had mutilated the snake’s wife, reveals that he did so only after watching her seduce another snake. Upon realizing his wife’s treachery, the grateful cobra grants the raja the ability to talk to animals."
Cover with Border of Abstract Floral Motifs,19th Century,Null,Lace,"Notable for its bright and valued colors, this cover has a needle lace border of natural and organic motifs attached to a silk cloth. The lace is divided into two registers, possibly representing stylized plants and flowers growing above ground with their roots growing in pots beneath them."

Twelve Months of Fruit:  August,18th Century,England,Print,"Robert Furber, one of the best-known plant dealers in London, published Twelve Months of Flowers and Twelve Months of Fruit in 1730 and 1732, respectively. These deluxe sales catalogues, the first ever produced in England, display some 400 flowers and 370 fruits arranged according to the months in which the flowers and fruit bloom or ripen. At least two dozen American plants are pictured, as the flora of the colonies quickly became available in Europe."
Decorated Amphora with Ibex Head,20th Century,Null,Vessels,"A splendid example of the decorated pottery known as ""palace ware,"" made only in Dynasty XVIII. It is painted with garlands imitating the real flowers with which vessels were draped at banquets. This vase was found in the palace of Amenhotep III at southern Thebes."

Black-Figure Neck-Amphora (Storage Vessel): Animal Friezes,7th - 6th Century BCE,Etruscan,Ceramics,"Although seemingly simple in design, this amphora populated with animals (some mythological) and vegetal ornaments speaks to complex cultural intermingling in the ancient world. Known as “Etrusco-Corinthian,” the vase was made in Vulci, an Etruscan site with local workshops influenced by the Greek pottery imported there. These imports, especially from the ancient city of Corinth, helped to bring certain motifs and creatures borrowed from the Near East—such as the griffins here—to the Italian peninsula. Among several lively Etruscan elements on this vase are flowering rosettes, including one about to be eaten by a stag foraging in the upper band."
Falcon on a Perch,17th Century,Null,Painting,"Falcons were prized participants in royal hunting expeditions, and this painting may be a portrait of a favorite bird or a gift from an ally. The bird faces left, and the talons are tied to the perch with a black string. The light green background, flowering trees, and plants provide dynamism to the composition and reveal the artist’s awareness of Persian, Mughal, or Deccani styles of painting."
A King Making Love in the Harem,18th Century,Null,Painting,"From a series of paintings valorizing the virility of the ruler, this scene of lovemaking is set in the lavish interior space of the palace women’s quarters. Mauve floral carpet, gold lattice window, and vessels for wine and breath-freshening paan enhance the scene. The marble walls with gold flowering plants and niches appear gray in the dim evening light."
Jacket (Haori),20th Century,Null,Textile,"The tie-dyeing technique called shibori seen in this jacket not only dyes a garment but also makes its surface puckered, adding both visual and tactile interest. Called a haori, this type of jacket is a formal one worn over a kimono. The flowers in the design may be chrysanthemums."
Luxembourg Gardens,20th Century,United States,Photograph,"Joel Meyerowitz here experiments with what he called “field photographs,” in which the entire picture plane is active instead of having one central incident occupy center stage. The main figure—the woman carrying the flowers—and the background seem to merge seamlessly, blending foreground and background together in a humorous, improbable whole."
"Garden Variations, Orange and Yellow",20th Century,United States,Painting,"Joseph O’Sickey’s most celebrated canvases, such as Garden Variations: Orange and Yellow, are hybrid still life and landscape subjects that he arranged and painted in his backyard. A frequent motif in this body of work is a cloth-covered table prepared for entertainment that takes center stage. Here, the table displays a bowl of fruit, vases of flowers, and bottled beverages. As this painting’s title suggests, bold color is a prominent compositional feature, creating a festive feeling appropriate for an informal outdoor gathering."
Bowl with Inlaid Chrysanthemum and Lychee Design,14th Century,Null,Ceramics,"As early as the seventh century, the practice of drinking tea and wine became an important part of elite leisure culture in Korea. A wide bowl like this example was especially suitable for drinking powdered tea shaved from a compressed tea cake, the most commonly enjoyed type during the Goryeo period. The outer wall is lavishly decorated with the inlaid image of flowering vines, the inner wall with the inlaid image of chrysanthemum and lychee. Such elaborate design tells us that tea wares then were aesthetically invested objects of luxury."
"A Woman Plucks Leaves While Awaiting Her Lover: Gunakali Ragini of Malkos, from the “Chawand Ragamala”",17th Century,Null,Painting,"On a terrace outside an open bedchamber, a dark-skinned woman wearing a skirt of peacock feathers plucks leaves from a tree and has filled her basket with flowers. She has made garlands and hung them on the trees, probably in accordance with a vow made in the ardent hope of bringing back her overdue lover. In accordance with the verse, two peacocks stand perched on the roof."

Girls sitting in Union Square fountain,20th Century,United States,Print,"Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Isabel Bishop arrived in New York City to study illustration in 1918. She explored the city from her studio on Fourteenth Street and Union Square, focusing mostly on the young working women in the neighborhood. Positioning her protagonists from a distance, as one might encounter them on a street, her works epitomize the pleasure of people watching in the city. Her subjects, many of whom stitched garments or made artificial flowers at hatmaker shops nearby, were consumers of fashion themselves. A tight-fitting skirt and stylish hat could assert femininity, personal expression, and modernity."
Woman's Silk Robe,18th Century,Null,Garment,"This rare private, rather than court, surcoat displays flowers of all seasons arranged with elegant simplicity. Included among the 25 symbolic flowers are peonies, plum blossoms, magnolias, and chrysanthemums."
White-Glazed Jar with Hidden Design,16th - 17th Century,Null,Ceramics,"White was a ritual color used in Buddhist ceremonies, as well as the color of mourning. This jar is made of two molded halves that were joined where the vessel’s middle section shows a raised line. It is covered by a silky white glaze called “sweet-white” (tianbai; 甜白). A “hidden design” (anhua; 暗花) of floral scrolls on the shoulder and stylized petals around the base shine through the glaze. The jar may have been used as a planter, a vase for flowers, or it may have held incense sticks on a home altar."
Illuminated Folio from a Gulistan (Rose Garden) of Sa'di (c. 1213–1291),15th Century,Iran,Manuscript,"In the border surrounding the Persian poetical text, deer and a lion coexist peacefully in a forest. This imagery may reference the rule of a righteous king. The text is from the Gulistan, one of the most celebrated works of Persian literature, completed around 1258. Gulistan means “Rose Garden” in Persian; just as a rose garden is a collection of flowers, the contents are a collection of anecdotes. This page is from the section “On the Conduct of Kings.”"
Vase with Plum Blossoms,20th Century,Japan,Ceramics,"Broad access to high-quality Chinese ceramics occasioned by the collapse of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) and the dispersal of elite Chinese collections presented Seifū Yohei IV with models for both molded decoration, in which molds are used to press clay into shapes, and painted motifs. Yohei IV’s all-over design of budding and flowering plum blossoms, strongly associated with spring and with China, is combined with his father’s “water color” glaze on this vase."

Durga Slaying Mahisha,19th Century,Null,Painting,"According to the text dedicated to the exploits of the great goddess Devi in her various forms, there was a time in the mythic past when a buffalo demon was ravaging the world. Storm clouds swirl above and dust below him. The goddess in her warrior aspect in which she is named Durga rides a chariot pulled by two leonine tigers with blue skies and flowering trees above her. The two are about to clash in a bloody battle that will take place on the gently sloping hillside evocative of the western Himalayan foothills where this painting was made."
Coat,20th Century,Null,Garment,"Coats with a band collar, fastened at the waist, have a Central Asian origin and are known by the Turkish term choga, meaning “long-sleeved garment.” During the mid-1800s, it was fashionable for Indian men of high social status to wear chogas as their outermost layer. The intricate ornamentation in the form of stylized unripe mangoes and flowering plants is the specialty of artisans in Kashmir, where they had access to the fine wool of Himalayan goats. The coats, however, were popular in many regions throughout India."
Dish with Figures in a Chinese Garden,18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This dish is inscribed with a poem from The Gateless Gate, a text compiled by Chinese Chan (Zen) master Wumen Huikai (1183–1260). The verse reads, “I always remember the spring in Jiangnan. Where the partridges sing; how fragrant the countless flowers!”"
"The Parrot Addresses Khujasta at the Beginning of the Eighth Night, from a Tuti-nama (Tales of a Parrot)",16th Century,Null,Painting,"On the eighth night, the parrot tells Khujasta a story—the most lavishly illustrated of all the chapters in the book—that has important parallels with the experiences of Emperor Akbar himself. The overarching tale is about a prince who maintained a vow of silence despite being imprisoned and taken to be executed on seven consecutive days. Each day, the king was convinced to stop the execution after hearing a story told by one of his seven viziers, or ministers. The adjacent paintings illustrate scenes from the overarching tale as well as the fifth vizier's story. The golden sky, purple hills, cyprus tree, and flowering branches are elements learned from Persian painting. Indian sources contributed the bolster that appears to float on the suggestively red-colored plane of the bed."
Bag,19th Century,Null,Textile,"This colorful bag is beaded on both sides. On one side, the flowers resemble the sun, which native peoples of the Woodlands regard as the supreme spirit; the visual parallel is probably intentional. On the other side, a different plant symmetrically spreads its leaves and flowers across a dark, contrasting ground."

Symbols of Longevity: Deer under Peach and Pine,19th Century,Japan,Painting,"This pair of hanging scrolls is replete with images symbolizing longevity. Peaches, associated with immortality, hang in abundance from a tree in the left scroll, while pines, known for being eternally green, twist together in the right scroll. Beneath the trees stand two bucks, one of whom gazes at a doe seated on the ground as he licks his coat. Medicine made from deer antlers is said to promote health. Mushrooms, in bright red and green, seen in the left scroll, are said to confer immortality upon those who eat them, and the small waterfall in the right scroll speaks to the infinite flexibility and abundance flowing through life. Toda Tadanaka, the son of the ruler of Noto province and a military leader himself, trained with trained with Mori Ransai (1740-1801), a painter known for colorful bird-and-flower compositions in the style of Shen Nanping. The style is more generally referred to as the Nagasaki style, indicating the port city in which a number of Chinese painters were active in the Edo period (1615-1868)."
Dish with Inlaid Plant Design,14th Century,Null,Ceramics,"As early as the seventh century, the practice of drinking tea and wine became an important part of elite leisure culture in Korea. A wide bowl like this example was especially suitable for drinking powdered tea shaved from a compressed tea cake, the most commonly enjoyed type during the Goryeo period. The inlaid image of bloomed white flowers on the inner wall of this tea bowl must have made the moment of drinking tea more enjoyable."

The Little Fortune,15th Century,Germany,Print,"With the help of a staff, Fortuna, the goddess of fortune or chance, balances on a sphere and holds a sprig of flowers in her left hand. In addition to representing her instability, the sphere suggests the worldly domain over which she influences at random. The flowers, traditionally identified as Eryngium, held aphrodisiac powers, suggesting the fickle nature of love. A more recent interpretation identifies them as Sternkraut, a plant that symbolized the idea that one’s fate has already been written. Both readings of the engraving, whether it regards love or life, inform the viewer that destiny is not of one’s own choosing."
Landscape Near Paris,19th Century,France,Drawing,"In his delicate studies of flowers and fields, like this panoramic view of the distant Paris, Bonvin captured the beauty of nature, observed with an innocent, untrained eye. His untutored responses to nature permitted him to be more experimental than his contemporaries working in watercolor. A realist in his rendering of natural detail, Bonvin simultaneously foreshadowed Impressionism with his interest in light and atmosphere."
Inro (Case) with Egrets and Willows,18th Century,Null,Lacquer,"The iridescence of this inro is due to the shell inlay used to form the design of an egret (a waterfowl) standing among reeds in water beneath a weeping willow on one side and an egret resting in a tree on the other. The metal ojime (cinch) has a floral design, and the round lacquer netsuke, or toggle, has an image of a Chinese gentleman, possibly an immortal, holding flowers planted in a shallow pot."
Bird Sleeping on a Plum Tree,20th Century,Korea,Painting,"The plum’s status as the orthodox symbol of the literati’s pure spirit originated in Lin Bu’s poem ""Tiny Plum Flowers in Mountain Garden."" The plum was also widely depicted in Korean paintings as part of the Four Gentlemen—or Four Gracious Plants—motif. Here, the plum and bamboo express literati spirituality while the bird with its head pointing downward indicates the artist’s feelings about the unstable situation at the end of the Joseon period. Yang Ki-hun was a Korean scholar-official renowned for painting and calligraphy. King Gojong (reigned 1863–1907) was one of Yang's prominent patrons."
Lady Holding a Vase,12th - 13th Century,Null,Ceramics,"The Cizhou ware kilns never produced for the imperial court, but made potted utensils needed in daily life. They also fired ceramic figurines, which are believed to have been used as toys. The maid or palace lady here holds a long-necked vase of a type that watered flowers. The figurine, perhaps made as a toy for a girl, was molded in clay and covered with a white slip and transparent glaze, over which some colors in red, green, and ocher were applied. Cizhou kiln potters were one of the first in China who applied overglaze enamel-like colors on glazed, high-fired ceramics."
"The prince, with the help of Mukhlis who changes into a frog, recovers the ring lost in the sea, and returns it to the king, from a Tuti-nama (Tales of a Parrot): Eighteenth Night",16th Century,Null,Painting,"The prince arrived at a royal capital, where he pledged to assist the local king in any tasks. One day, when fishing at sea, the king dropped a precious ring into the water. The prince asked his servant, the frog, to retrieve it. At the left, the prince respectfully returns the ring to the king on his throne. The frog is at the entrance of the walled harbor to the sea, where a boatman bails water. Lotus flowers have been painted among the swirling eddies."
Tea Whisk-Shaped Sake Bottle,17th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This sake bottle resembles a whisk used in preparing powdered green tea, with the handle at the top and the body of the brush flaring out below. Its bold design is anchored by images of chrysanthemums and pomegranates set in panels against a ground of red hatching with tri-colored clouds. Additional patterns of swirls, stripes, flowers, and other forms make the piece eye-popping."

Poem on Plum,18th - 19th Century,Korea,Calligraphy,"For Yi Hwang, a celebrated scholar and poet in 16th-century Korea, writing poems was an escape from partisan politics. Because its flowers often bloom in the middle of winter, Joseon period Korean scholars like Yi found plum blossoms a perfect subject to express the value of endurance and self-cultivation. In his numerous poems, Yi used plum blossom imagery to express his feelings. The poem on this hanging scroll reads: “Wishing to fly away, red leaves left the mountain villa. Their large sleeves are frosted due to blue clouds. The clouds in the sky look upright, which are beyond human beings’ ability. The plum tree whispered to me that [the leaves] fell from the wind and landed on the fence.” The mountain villa in this poem may refer to the Dosan Academy, a Confucian school that Yi established after his retirement, and the red leaves of the plum blossom are probably Yi’s poetic personification."
The Heroine Who Waits Anxiously for Her Absent Lover (Utka Nayika),19th Century,Null,Painting,"Inspired by devotional poetry that likens the waiting for divine favor to that of a woman alone in the forest waiting for her lover, Pahari painters mastered portrayals of this subject. Darkness has fallen, but the moon and stars and jasmine flowers brighten the night. However, monsoon clouds approach in the distance, suggesting impending danger and misery. Her gesture and expression suggest a mixture of hope and heightened uncertainty about how much longer she should continue to wait."
Bowl with Carved Design,12th - 13th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This conical bowl and the shallow and wide one (CMA 2020.183) are both hand-incised with decoration suggesting waves, clouds, or floral sprays. All of these motifs had auspicious meaning: waves and clouds bring rain that fertilizes the fields, and flowers and plants were often associated with the beauty of human virtues. The carved and combed designs were swiftly cut with a wooden tool into the unfired leather-hard body before glazing. Once the glaze was applied, it pooled in the incised areas rendering the design more visible."

"Rubbing of Imperial Procession with Empress, taken from Northern Wei dynasty (386-534) Central Binyang Cave, Longmen, Henan Province",20th Century,Null,Miscellaneous,"This rubbing was taken from stone reliefs commissioned by the Northern Wei emperor Xuanwu (reigned 500–515) in honor of his deceased parents. In this rubbing, the empress mother is in the center, crowned with an elaborate headdress and attended by an entourage of palace ladies. The empress mother is about to place an incense stick into a censer held by a lady on the left side. Other attendants carry offerings for the Buddha, such as lotus flowers, a symbol of purity in Buddhism. The second part of the imperial procession, showing the emperor with male attendants, is depicted in another rubbing in the CMA collection, 1916.64."

Young Woman Reading,19th Century,France,Print,"Primarily a sculptor of medals, Charpentier used embossing techniques to lend three-dimensionality to this print featuring his typical subject matter featuring everyday life. Charpentier was also aware of Japanese woodcuts circulating in Paris during the late 19th century, which provided a precedent for using embossing to create pattern and a three-dimensional effect on a flat sheet of paper. The areas in relief add texture to the waves of the woman's hair and to her dress. Embossing was also used to create the vase of flowers just above the figure's open book."
View of the Parthenon,19th Century,France,Photograph,"Adolphe marketed his photos of flowers, artworks, landscapes, and monuments from across Europe throughout that continent and in North America.

The image on a carbon print is formed from pigmented gelatin, which is far more resistant to fading than the silver or metal salts in silver-based prints."
Untitled,21st Century,Japan,Photograph,"Now in his eighties, infirmities and the pandemic have led Araki to turn his camera on his neighborhood and his home, which is filled with small tableaux created with toys and artificial flowers, among other items.

Bride's Robe,19th - 20th Century,Null,Garment,"This bride's robe is exquisitely embroidered with various symbols of happiness in colorful silk threads. Butterflies stand for marital happiness; the phoenix, numerous offspring; and lotus flowers and white cranes, longevity. Yet, the bridal gown does not attest to the life of luxury. To the contrary, many traces of repairs, trimmings, and patchwork reflect Joseon-period women’s commitment to value aesthetics of frugality and modesty. Substantial repairs and patching reveal that this gown served as an important communal resource to be shared and passed down through several generations.

Habitat-Venus,21st Century,Argentina,Photograph,"Fabiana Barreda, an Argentinian photographer, video and performance artist, curator, and art critic, produces art concerned with environmental issues. Simple line drawings on “Venus’s” body link her womb, heart, and hand, delicately sketching out emblems for home, love, and the beauty of nature. The verdant background and lush flowers in the woman’s hair reaffirm age-old associations of women with sensuality, fertility, and nature."
Floral striped silk on a golden ground,17th Century,Null,Textile,"Twelve jewel-like colors of silk thread illustrate the vivacity of colors extolled in Iranian flowers on gilt- and silver-metal thread grounds. In a simplified seminaturalistic style, swaying branches support an exuberant array of blossoms in the Safavid tradition while the botanical accuracy of European prints inspired flora in varied angles and stages of maturity. Although celebrated in Iranian poetry for centuries, flowers were not featured in paintings and textiles until the 1640s, inspired by European herbals. This sturdy silk retains its radiant colors in contrast with many silks that have faded from excessive light exposure, especially the reds and pinks that were dyed with light-sensitive safflower dyestuff."
Bifolio from a Book of Hours: Initial V with Floral Border (recto),15th Century,Null,Manuscript,"The word dirge, today meaning a mournful hymn for funerals, comes from the opening Latin in the Office of the Dead, seen just after the decorative letter A at upper left. During the Middle Ages, dirge became the shortened way to refer to the Office of the Dead. Although primarily recited at funerals, the office was also prayed at home as a reminder of mortality and a protection against sudden death. Surrounding the text, which contains Psalm 5, is a border decoration of acanthus leaves, believed to grow in paradise, as well as a parrot, a squirrel, a beetle, and flowers."

Such designs are reflected in the tiles, ceramic vessels, and metalwork of Muslim-occupied Spain. The origin of the doors is not known, but they may have belonged to a palace or domestic residence. In 711, the Moors had invaded and conquered nearly the entire peninsula. During the next 750 years, independent Muslim states were established, and the entire area of Muslim control became known as Al-Andalus.

Bride's Robe,18th Century,Null,Garment,"This bride's robe is exquisitely embroidered with various symbols of happiness in colorful silk threads. Butterflies stand for marital happiness; the phoenix, numerous offspring; and lotus flowers and white cranes, longevity. Yet, the bridal gown does not attest to the life of luxury. To the contrary, many traces of repairs, trimmings, and patchwork reflect women’s commitment to value aesthetics of frugality and modesty in the Joseon period.

 and spangles, or polished metal discs."
Headdress (beniqa),19th Century,Null,Embroidery,"Beniqa were stylish headdresses that women wore when visiting the hammam (steam bath). The linen fabric absorbed the damp from their wet hair. With its gold and silver metal thread, shimmering spangles, and brightly colored threads forming flowers and vines, this beniqa was a ceremonial garment worn for the ritual bath before a Jewish woman’s wedding; it was also part of her dowry. After toweling off her hair, a woman made two braids, which she would then twist into the cap’s fabric and tie on her head, with the gold-fringed ends trailing down."

"Lillium Pomponium (Turban Lily), plate 7 from Les Liliacées",19th Century,France,Print,"The Belgian Pierre-Joseph Redouté became the most celebrated botanical illustrator of his day, serving as court painter in France to Marie Antoinette and later, the Empress Josephina. Called the “Raphaël des fleurs” (Raphael of flowers), he published two lavish collections of his botanical illustrations that were reproduced as stipple engravings, printed in color, and finished with painting by hand. This is one plate from the eight-volume Les Liliacées (1802–1816), which is devoted to the lily family—plants that grow from bulbs, corms, or tubers."

A lion and a leonine figure with a human face bound enthusiastically as part of a parade of creatures who circle the monument in the proscribed clockwise direction. The exaggerated linear outlining of their features and the flatness of their bodies are stylistic features of relief sculpture from this period. The motif in the center has vegetal fronds symmetrically springing from a lotus rosette in the form of an auspicious symbol called shrivatsa, which is also found on the chests of Jinas-liberated beings of the Jain tradition-and the Hindu god Vishnu."

Harvested rice fields to the right and flowering cherry blossom trees at left show seasonal change from winter to spring."
Apple Blossoms,19th Century,United States,Painting,"Heade made many studies of flowers, beginning around 1860. Born in Pennsylvania, he became a professional portrait painter before visiting France, England, and Italy between 1840 and 1843. An inveterate traveler, Heade went to Europe again in the late 1840s, lived briefly in several American cities, visited South America on at least three occasions, and finally settled in Florida in 1883."

Leaf from a Psalter and Prayerbook: Initial E with Ornamental Border Containing a Seated Satyr and a Bird Eating Grapes (recto) and Ornamental Border with Flowers and Squirrel (verso) (2 of 3 Excised Leaves),16th Century,Null,Manuscript,"This leaf reveals the charm of secular decoration such as satyrs or domestic activities like cooking. Such details would have been a sumptuous delight to the original owner. The original book was a highly personalized volume apparently written and illuminated in North Germany as suggested by internal textual references. The prominent inclusion of Saint Godehard (died 1038), Bishop of Hildesheim, in the calendar (not visible) would suggest that the manuscript was produced in that city."
Vase,19th Century,France,Metalwork,"In style, the vase is resoundingly eclectic. It derives its form from a slightly modified ancient Greek amphora-a two-handled jar having a narrow neck. Contemporaries described its style as neo-grec (new Greek) or Byzantine. Today, however, we would not choose those terms. It is true that the surface decoration of the vase is based upon the scrolling pattern of a classical acanthus design-an arrangement of leaves and flowers-but the sharp, spiky details point to possible Islamic modifications of this pattern. The colors of the enamels are related to medieval European examples, particularly 12th-century Netherlandish work from the Mosan region. The decoration of this vase exemplifies a technical innovation introduced by the Barbedienne firm around 1860. In casting the metal from which the piece is formed, many small grooves were created on its surface. Later these grooves and other broader recessed areas were filled with colored enamels to create a predetermined ornamental design."
Dish with Carved Floral Design,12th - 13th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This shallow and wide bowl and the conical one (CMA 2020.182) are both hand-incised with decoration suggesting waves, clouds, or floral sprays. All of these motifs had auspicious meaning: waves and clouds bring rain that fertilizes the fields, and flowers and plants were often associated with the beauty of human virtues. The carved and combed designs were swiftly cut with a wooden tool into the unfired leather-hard body before glazing. Once the glaze was applied, it pooled in the incised areas rendering the design more visible."
Paintings after Ancient Masters: Lotus and Rocks,16th Century,China,Painting,"The twenty paintings in this double album by Chen Hongshou include landscapes, figures, and flowers. It also has one leaf featuring a woman, an often-used subject not found in the other albums from the latter part of his career. Chen's late works are wonderful summations of his peculiar and quirky art—archaistic, hyper-refined—but without accompanying shallowness or sentimentality.His figures and landscapes in the late albums are miniaturized, not unlike the small Chinese gardens, or the carefully selected small table rocks or old roots used for contemplation to see the world in miniature. This loss of scale is quite deliberate and reflects the psychological situation of a depressed class like the Ming loyalist officials and scholars, deprived of their integrity and honor, and forced to lead a diminished and restricted existence."

They represent the intricate decoration found throughout the parent volume, its leaves now dispersed. Virtually every border, recto and verso, or front and back, was decorated with liquid gold and highlighted with a variety of flowers, fruits, vegetables, and animals; here a bird eats grapes while seated below is a satyr, or half goat and half man."

Nature Divinity (Yakshi) with Dwarf Hermaphrodite,2nd Century BCE,Null,Sculpture,"Nature divinities, or yakshis, are associated with the life-giving forces of plants, so her headdress includes a dramatic array of leaves and flowers. Her companion, a female figure with male genitalia, is a dwarf who has connections with the fecundity of the earth. Terracotta figurines were often venerated in domestic shrines for the ongoing prosperity of the family."
"Floral Panel, Probably from a Curtain",17th Century,Null,Embroidery,"Natural forms and brilliant colors of silk thread radiate in this embroidery. The refined floral sprays are offset in successive rows and repeated every sixth row. Flies, moths, and other insects are scattered among them, and a seated squirrel eats a hazelnut. The profusion of flowers and plants, such as thistles, hazelnuts, and foxgloves, were probably copied from pattern books that were increasingly available to embroiderers. Only a master embroiderer could have created such splendor evidenced here."
Peonies,13th Century,Null,Painting,"In China, the peony is considered the Queen of Flowers, representing the late spring season. The shrubs of this tree peony are in full bloom, blossoming in various colors. Peony paintings were popular from the Southern Song period to the Ming dynasty.

Tares,20th Century,United States,Print,"In a close-up view of flowers gone to seed, Baumann captures the sensation of slender, freestanding, resilient stalks floating in a breeze. Intricate carving of the woodblocks describes the delicacy and beauty of a common weed. The tiny yellow flowers dry and shrivel while the downy white spheres dissolve and the wind scatters the seeds. An image of transience, Tares symbolizes regeneration and the cycles of nature. At the end of his career, Baumann reduced the number of blocks to carve. Only four blocks were used for Tares so that design, rather than color, is responsible for the success of the image."

The Roses: China or Bengal Rose,19th Century,France,Print,"Hailed as the ""Raphael of Flowers,"" Redouté achieved an international reputation for his botanical illustrations in watercolor, which were interpreted in the most refined techniques of stipple engraving and published in lavish portfolios. He was close friends with the empress Joséphine who, after marrying Napoléon Bonaparte in 1795, built an immense hothouse to shelter her magnificent collection of rare and exotic plants and opulent gardens at their country estate, Malmaison.  Joséphine also spent vast sums to catalogue her floral collections and so commissioned Redouté to record her 250 different species of roses. Redouté employed a workshop of 18 printmakers to execute the plates, which were inked à la poupée (see glossary) and then retouched with watercolor."
Leaf from a Book of Hours: The Raising of the Cross,16th Century,Null,Manuscript,"This finely painted miniature is the work of an artist familiar with the designs of Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528). Though not deriving from a known engraving or drawing, the style, composition, and especially the modeling of the figure of Christ refer to the draftsmanship and tonalities found in Dürer's works. This miniature depicts the moment the cross is raised. In the foreground, thuggish brutes struggle to bring it upright. The skull of Adam at the foot of the cross signifies that Golgotha was Adam's burial place. In the background, a vivid blue sky recedes into pink as it meets the horizon and a distant town. The inclusion of an illusionistic, trompe l'oeil border, strewn with flowers and butterflies on a gold ground, follows the tradition of Ghent and Bruges, where such borders were first developed during the 1470s and 1480s."
Leaf Excised from a Book of Hours: The Nativity,15th Century,Belgium,Manuscript,"This book, made by an artist of the Ghent-Bruges school of illumination, represents the culmination of Flemish book painting. Its main features were the use of rich colors, decorative and illusionistic effects, a love of landscape, and a strong sense of visual narrative. Its most distinctive innovation was the development of a new style of border decoration featuring realistic motifs which cast shadows onto colored grounds to create an effect of spaciousness. These motifs included a diverse assortment of flowers, butterflies, insects, birds, and sprays of acanthus foliage."

Half-hidden behind their curtain of blossoms, these monuments no longer memorialize the violence of war but meld quietly into the peaceful landscape."
Pair of Boots,11th - 12th Century,Null,Garment,"The fabric and tailoring of garments have always defined social status. For these boots, different outer fabrics were used: a patterned silk for the leg portion, and tapestry (kesi) for the foot. Since both were considered luxury fabrics, they were pieced together from remnants too precious to discard. Consequently, the silk pattern was not used in relation to the form of the boot. By contrast, these boots would have been made for a court official, not a member of the imperial family. The patterned silk was woven with geese flanking a vase of flowers on a stand and surrounded by cloud scrolls. The Chinese motif of flowers arranged in a vase was adopted by the Liao during the 11th century and indicates an 11th- or early 12th-century date for the boots."

Arranged in bands, motifs include stylized trees (or protective hands), flowers, eight-pointed stars, and geometric designs. The mirrored Kufic (squared Arabic script) lettering in teal is likely the name of the weaver or panel owner. Weavers with Muslim Andalusian (southern Spanish) heritage originally made these, drawing from Andalusian and Turkish motifs; later, workshops in Tunis produced them."
Sarong,19th Century,Null,Textile,"Batiks made in the North Coast region of Java, specifically in Pekalongan, were influenced by both Indian and European motifs due to the Dutch presence in Indonesia. In this sarong we see a mixture of Indian and European flowers including jasmine, lilac, and daffodil. Batik is a wax-resist dyeing technique used throughout Java. Hot wax is applied with a tool known as a canting and a design is hand drawn with incredible skill. This sarong was then dyed with indigo, a well sought after and culturally important natural dye. Areas on the fabric with wax will not accept the indigo dye, hence the term wax-resist."

Plum Blossoms,18th Century,China,Painting,"A native of Anhui province, Wang Shishen was a professional painter who specialized in plum blossoms. He moved to Yangzhou in the late 1720s to seek patrons. Here, the daring composition of a flowering plum branch is balanced through the addition of four poems. Wang’s poems evoke nostalgia for the forgotten Six Dynasties period and the glorious Sui dynasty, during which the Grand Canal was built while Yangzhou was the southern capital of the empire. Other inscriptions in the upper part of the painting allude to the fact that Wang had developed blindness in one eye, probably at the time he conceived this painting."

Zephyre and Flore,18th Century,France,Print,"Following the method of Bonnet, his mentor and colleague, Janinet created luxurious sets of color prints with printed gold frames and passed them off as foreign imports. Because the printmakers’ unauthorized use of gold leaf was eventually caught, only a limited number of gilded examples were produced.

Bowl,18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Flowers in vivid colors including peonies, lilies, and chrysanthemums are set against a brilliant red enamel ground. The petals and veins of leaves are depicted in fine outlines and soft colors demonstrating the craftsman’s excellent painting skill. This porcelain exemplifies the technical perfection of Qing dynasty court artisans who surpassed their predecessors in technical skill. The bowl bears a mark on its base reading “Made for Emperor Yongzheng 雍正御製.” The Yongzheng emperor was one of the three early Qing emperors whose taste greatly influenced art production and collecting."

Women Chasing Crickets on an Autumn Moor,18th Century,Japan,Print,"In the waning days of summer, autumn insects begin to sing, heralding the approach of autumn. The two courtesans and their servant chase crickets among flowering bush clover, one of the flowers of autumn. In the background ancient courtiers enjoy the same pastime. Note the plovers, or chidori, on the kimono of the woman on the left. These are shorebirds that migrate through Japan during the autumn and spring. Chidori in flight have been a favored theme of art and poetry for more than a thousand years in Japan."
"Radha Awaiting Reconciliation with Krishna, from a Gita Govinda of Jayadeva",17th Century,Null,Painting,"The artist has depicted Krishna’s favorite lover, Radha, six times to emphasize her agitation while she waits for Krishna. She has made intimate enclosures of flowering branches for their tryst, she pleads with a picture of him, and she lays out blossoms and liquor under a tree in preparation. Her confidante makes an appeal to Krishna who sits under a tree at right, seemingly unmoved and dispassionate. The viewer is meant to put oneself in the place of Radha, and feel her intense longing for Krishna. Even when it seems like the god does not come when he promises, that he does not care, the devotee, like Radha, should continue to wait and prepare to receive him."

Gunakali Ragini,18th Century,Null,Painting,"Paintings made in the city of Jaipur took on a confectionary palette that became popular among newly expanded markets around India and abroad. With the disintegration of centralized imperial power, the Rajput kingdom of Jaipur began independently producing art that had mass appeal. Sets of paintings by royal court artists, such as the Ragamala series from which this page came, were made for sale, rather than for the private collection of the king. The revenues from their sale ensured the prosperity of the kingdom. The verse associated with Gunakali Ragini, a wintertime raga, states that the heroine “sets mandara flowers in a golden jar and seated, plucks them, with her mind fixed on love’s sport.”"
Chasuble,17th Century,Null,Embroidery,"This rare chasuble decorated with angels, musicians, pomegranates, and flowers represents Sacred and Profane Love. This is indicated by two figures—a clear-sighted figure embracing a blindfolded figure—standing on a globe in the upper center and also by the musicians. The angels play soft-sounding instruments (harpsichords, harps, viole da barccio, and flutes) while earthy figures play loud instruments (tambours and hunting horns). The chasuble was most likely part of a liturgical set commissioned for a wedding. This entire chasuble is embroidered with silk and metal thread laid over linen and stitched in place. The exceptionally fine workmanship, lavish use of gold and silver, and brilliant silk thread create this sumptuous vestment."

Bust of Mademoiselle Lender,19th Century,France,Print,"Toulouse-Lautrec made several portraits of the actress Marcelle Lender at the height of her stardom in 1895 when she was featured in the operetta Chilpéric--libretto and music by Hervé--performed at the Théâtre des Variétés in Paris. The artist attended the production on more than 20 occasions, arriving just in time to see the final bolero in which Lender’s multilayered skirts created an explosion of bright pink and green tulle as she danced. With the fuchsia flowers and green cape, Toulouse-Lautrec evoked the performance that helped win Lender acclaim."
Blessed Lord Buddha,19th Century,Null,Painting,"The central figure of the Buddha, radiating light and the flame of enlightenment, is flanked by his four main disciples: Sariputra and the blue Moggallana on his left, and Ananda and Anuruddha on his right. Below him is the earth goddess holding a pot of water on her head. To her right are three guardians of Sri Lanka: Kataragama (or Skanda) with six heads and twelve arms; the blue Vibhishana, younger brother of Ravana; and, smaller in size, may be Pattina holding an anklet and neem leaf. On the opposite side are three deities: Sumana, the four-faced Brahma, and four-armed Shiva with trident. Arranged around two depictions of the bodhi tree under which the Buddha reached enlightenment, rows of other monks bear garlands in veneration. Each of the standing protector divinities around the periphery grasps a bow and arrow.This painting evokes the appearance of 18th- to 19th-century murals in Sri Lankan Buddhist temple interiors, such as those at Dumbulla, with its rows of golden figures. It was probably part of a domestic shrine, along with small sculptures of the Buddha, palm-leaf manuscripts of Pali scriptures, incense, oil lamps, bells, and other offerings such as food, flowers, and water. The varnish that covers the painting may have been intended to shield it from the environment of an active place of worship."
Fragment,20th Century,Italy,Sculpture,"The Madonna sits upon a throne with the Christ Child standing on her knee.  He is steadied by his mother, turning delicately to grasp the Virgin's robe for support.  On the left is St. Francis, identified by his stigmata.  On the right, St. Anthony Abbot is identified by his monk's robe and T-shaped walking stick.  The brown robes of the saints, the purple of the Virgin's tunic (a shade characteristic of the artist), and the flesh tones of the figures contrast strongly against the bright blue background.  In the semicircular sky behind the figures, three winged cherub heads emerge, representing a host of angels.  
The inclusion of St. Francis in this altarpiece honors the saint, suggesting that the altarpiece may have been originally built into the wall of a Franciscan institution in Tuscany.  Two shields bearing the Borgherini family crest appear in the lower portion of the altarpiece's border, further suggesting that the chapel for which this altarpiece was made was likely owned or endowed by the family.  
Glazed terracotta is both durable and decorative and the gleaming white of this piece would have stood out in the darkness of a church.  The medium was made popular by Renaissance artist Luca della Robbia and came into fashion as a substitute for expensive carved marble.  A rounded arch frame embellished with fruit and flower garlands as well as egg-and-dart and cord moldings accompanied the work when it was acquired, but was later determined not to be original and removed.  Buglioni's work bears the influence of the della Robbias, particularly in the simple color scheme.  Buglioni likely worked in the studio of Luca's nephew, Andrea, where he would have learned the technique of glazing terracotta."

Leaf Excised from a Book of Hours: Decorated Initial H,15th Century,Netherlands,Manuscript,"The difficulty in localizing Dutch manuscripts of the second half of the 15th century is formidable. Many shared or exchanged characteristics are found, particularly in terms of page layout, border decoration, and initial design. The present leaf contains borders embellished with brightly colored flowers (columbines) and acanthus leaves filled in with gold bezants, tiny green leaves, and little black dots. Though different in palette, these elements bear closest resemblance to borders and initials produced by a group of artists associated with the Zwolle Bible (Utrecht, Universiteitsbibliotheek, MS. 31). The original illuminators are believed to have worked within the Monastery of the Canons Regular at Agnietenberg. This leaf is painted in an associated style by an artist who must have been familiar with the Zwolle group."
Bottle-shaped Vase,18th Century,Null,Ceramics,"This spectacular vase, one of a pair in the collection, depicts flowering and fruiting peach trees to convey an auspicious message of affluence and long life. Developments in enamel technology led to new possibilities in polychrome decoration of Qing imperial porcelains. Pinks appeared, lending their name to the new palette of overglaze colors (famille rose), and the addition of opaque white allowed painters to vary the value of pigments, enhancing the painterly quality of porcelain decoration."

Pair of Boots,11th - 12th Century,Null,Garment,"The fabric and tailoring of garments have always defined social status. For these boots, different outer fabrics were used: a patterned silk for the leg portion, and tapestry (kesi) for the foot. Since both were considered luxury fabrics, they were pieced together from remnants too precious to discard. Consequently, the silk pattern was not used in relation to the form of the boot, as seen in some other imperial boots. By contrast, these boots would have been made for a court official, not a member of the imperial family. The patterned silk was woven with geese flanking a vase of flowers on a stand and surrounded by cloud scrolls. The Chinese motif of flowers arranged in a vase was adopted by the Liao during the 11th century and indicates an 11th- or early 12th-century date for the boots."
Queen of the May,19th Century,England,Photograph,"A major figure in the development of British photography, Cameron elevated the portrait to new artistic heights. She never opened a commercial studio or accepted commissions, but she was one of the first photographers to sell her photographs through a fine art gallery. Friends, neighbors, family, and servants were cajoled into modeling for portraits as themselves and as allegorical figures from history, religion, mythology, and literature. Little is known about Emily Peacock, who posed here as the protagonist in The May Queen by Britain’s poet laureate Alfred Tennyson. Typically crowned with flowers, the May Queen is selected as part of the celebrations on May 1, a traditional spring holiday in many cultures in the Northern Hemisphere."

Snakeshead,20th Century,England,Textile,"When Morris designed Snakeshead in 1877, Indian silks were in style and widely imported from British India. This design stands out for its diminutive motifs and the strong red and black colors, which were fashionable only for a short time before paler hues regained favor with clients. While its color scheme suggests distant lands with warmer climates, the pattern showcases one of Morris’s favorite flowers: the fritillary, a wildflower that he remembered growing in the meadows near Oxford."

It also has one leaf featuring a woman, an often-used subject not found in the other albums from the latter part of his career. His late works are wonderful summations of Chen's peculiar and quirky art--archaistic, hyper-refined--but without accompanying shallowness or sentimentality.His figures and landscapes in the late albums are miniaturized, not unlike the small Chinese gardens, or the carefully selected small table rocks or old roots used for contemplation to see the world in miniature. This loss of scale is quite deliberate and reflects the psychological situation of a depressed class like the Ming loyalist officials and scholars, deprived of their integrity and honor, and forced to lead a diminished and restricted existence."

Camera Work: Still Life [Flowering Shrub in Glass],20th Century,United States,Books,
Pendant,14th Century,Null,Embroidery,"Pendants were used extensively in Buddhist settings where they were attached to almost anything needing decoration: ritual objects, canopies, valances, pillars, and other architectural components. They could be made in a variety of ways. This example consists of a heading and six tiers, each embroidered separately and then attached, one to the next. The earliest known pendant of this type was found in Central Asia and dates from the Tang dynasty (AD 618-907). The 14th-century date of this pendant is indicated by the style of the flowers."
Still Life with Cantaloupe,19th Century,United States,Painting,"Brown's early works were softly painted, romantic landscapes, but in the 1860s he turned almost exclusively to still lifes. He renounced the fluid style of his earlier landscapes and began to paint carefully contrived arrangements of fruit and flowers with almost photographic clarity. Brown became one of a number of painters to gain fame through reproductions made with the new printing process of chromolithography (a multicolor lithograph in which each color is printed from a separate stone or metal plate)."

The tradition of Mennecy's decoration on soft-paste porcelain can be recognized in the piece, but its style has been modified in response to the emerging neo-classic taste. The flowers are now organized into formal garland's and motifs of classical origin, such as the lion's heads, are introduced."

Known for its traditional K’iche’ Maya culture, it is the site of a large market where vendors sell everything from animals and tools to handicrafts and flowers--a colorful outdoor spectacle that attracts natives and tourists alike."
Portrait of a Woman,19th Century,France,Drawing,"Béranger is known as an academic painter of genre subjects. This pastel study of a young woman with downcast eyes conveys a sense of vitality and immediacy lacking in his more highly finished works in oil. While the graceful features of her face are articulated with tender detail, the flowers adorning her hair are summarily indicated with a handful of rapid strokes, and her bodice is barely suggested."
Bamboo and Plum,16th Century,Japan,Painting,"This painting of a white plum (or prunus) and bamboo was once part of a triptych. A central image of the demon-queller Zhong Kui was flanked by this painting and one of a red plum and bamboo. The paintings would have been suitable to hang after the turn of the new year, when Zhong Kui would drive out evil demons, and the year’s first flowers were in bloom. Sesson hailed from what is now Ibaraki prefecture in northern Honshu. A Zen monk, he spent much of his career in the Kanto region, and developed a distinctive style uninhibited by formal training in the Kano atelier."
A Lady-in-Waiting with Waist as Slender as a Willow from the series Flowers and Modern Beauties,19th Century,Japan,Print,
Eight Views of Kanazawa at Night,19th Century,Japan,Print,"Late in his career, Hiroshige explored the poetic theme of setsugekka, “snow, moon, and flowers,” in a set of three triptychs. This panoramic scene shows the autumn moon over Kanazawa, near Tokyo. Hiroshige’s contemporaries would have recognized the coastline dotted with villages, fishing boats, and the distinctive double-arched bridge at the bottom right."
Octopus and Melon,20th Century,Japan,Photograph,"Michiko Kon has created a remarkable body of work by assembling and photographing intricate still-life compositions. She employs a variety of materials in her constructions, such as fragments of raw fish, vegetables, flowers, and insects. Kon chooses perishable subjects, hoping to stimulate the viewer's five senses and ""because life contains a delicate beauty that attracts other objects, and a time limit."" A fish market near her studio supplies much of the matter for Kon's works, including Octopus and Melon. The halved melon, covered with the skin of an octopus, alludes to the themes of life, death, and female sexuality."
Lampas with floral medallions in ogival lattice,16th Century,Null,Textile,"This signature Turkish brocaded silk has a classic elegance associated with the artistic height of the 1500s. The prominent golden medallions and ogival (curved) lattice contrast with exceptionally delicate Turkish flowers—tulips, roses, carnations, and hyacinths—which all grow on a single vine. The symmetrical design and two complete medallions with lattices across the width are typical Turkish features of fine brocaded silks. Its original function is uncertain. Possibly it was intended for an imperial kaftan, a garment consisting of a long gown with sleeves reaching below the hands, examples of which are preserved in the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, the imperial center of the vast and wealthy Ottoman Empire."
Pair of Headpieces,10th - 12th Century,Null,Embroidery,"These headpieces are embroidered with butterflies, birds, animals, flowers, leaves, and delicate vine scrolls. In general, the design is related to the theme of the lotus pond, best known from Liao tomb paintings. Paired ducks or geese swimming in water and looking in opposite directions seem to have become popular in the north of China before spreading further south and to Central Asia. On the other hand, recumbent animals looking back are a Central Asian image that migrated to northern China. Headpieces of this shape, intersected by two bands and secured by ties, have a long history in northern China. A gold replica was found in a tomb dating as early as 500–550."
Silk hanging with embroidered tree of life,19th Century,Null,Embroidery,"This resplendent tree of life embroidery integrates Turkish traditions with new European styles that became increasingly fashionable during the mid-18th century. The fanciful tree projects lavish bouquets of Turkish flowers while the tree trunk is wrapped with an elaborate European-style bow, as are the meandering vines in the floral border. A professional draftsman drew the pattern with ink on the radiant yellow silk taffeta embroidered with at least 12 vibrant colors in chain stitch. It was most likely made in a professional workshop as a hanging for special occasions, a conspicuous symbol of beauty and wealth."
Dead Child On a Sofa,19th Century,Null,Photograph,"This carefully staged daguerreotype of a dead child is an outstanding example of a very common subject: the postmortem portrait. Using the stylistic conventions of the day, the unidentified artist successfully created a visually pleasing scene, despite the nature of the image. Dressed in white with a bouquet of flowers on the chest, the child, seen in profile, reclines on an elaborately patterned sofa. Delicate flesh tones were added to the cheek and arm, suggestive of a healthy child sleeping. The high rate of infant mortality throughout the 19th century made this variety of portraiture common, satisfying the emotional need of the parents to have a lasting memory of a loved one."
Iris #118,20th Century,Japan,Print,"Iris #118 recalls early Japanese folding screens in the way the beautiful flowers are painted on a gold background for a rich, decorative effect. Here, as with screens, squares of gold leaf were applied onto handmade Japanese paper. The artist then screenprinted the floral design and softened the glittering effect of the gold leaf by covering it with a pale wash."
The Dreamy Lobster,20th Century,United States,Print,"After spending a summer on an island off the coast of Maine, Peterdi was inspired to create this print. The artist explained: “Every morning I went down to the rocky shore searching for the treasures the pregnant ocean deposited there during the night. I watched the fishermen visit their traps, pull up big, green lobsters with terrifying claws. I followed the metamorphosis of these monsters from their virility while they were alive to the hollow, sun-bleached shells lying, like wilted flowers, on the pebble beach.”"
The Courtesan Takihime and Attendants (from the series New Patterns of Young Greens),18th Century,Japan,Print,"The designs on Takihime’s outer robe describes fragments of scenery—bridge, castle, wind-filled sails amid clouds—while her attendants’ robes are more conventionally decorated with scattered flowers. The tassels on their sleeves were worn only by young girls. All three wear the triple-fan crest of the Ogiya (""House of Fans"") tea house on the shoulders of their kimono. The cartouche in the upper-right corner of the print identifies the series title and time of year. It is New Year, the same season depicted in Engetsudo’s scroll Courtesan and Attendants (see 1985.255). Courtesans strolling through the streets with their attendants were common sights during evening hours in the Yoshiwara."
An Insect Ball,19th Century,France,Drawing,"J.-J. Grandville became best known for fantastical drawings like this one, in which insects act like humans. Here, smaller creatures above use flowers or leaves as musical instruments, and their larger counterparts below dance a galop. An Insect Ball was one of more than 50 drawings that the artist made for wood-engraved reproduction in Le Magasin pittoresque (The Picturesque Store), a popular encyclopedic review edited by Grandville's friend Edouard Charton. In text printed below the wood-engraved version of An Insect Ball, Grandville explained that his aim was to show insects with the same humorous personalities seen at any human ball, while also rendering their forms with scientific accuracy."
Cachepot,18th Century,France,Ceramics,"The mark on this piece indicates that it was made after the Mennecy factory was moved to Bourg-la- Reine in 1773. The tradition of Mennecy's decoration on soft-paste porcelain can be recognized in the piece, but its style has been modified in response to the emerging neo-classic taste. The flowers are now organized into formal garland's and motifs of classical origin, such as the lion's heads, are introduced."
"Binzasara, A Dance with Clappers (From the series Entertainments at the Height of the Niwaka Festival in the Pleasure Quarters)",18th Century,Japan,Print,During the eighth lunar month of each year the geisha of the pleasure quarters would form themselves into groups and proceed around the quarter performing dances and skits. It seems likely that woodblock prints featuring the Niwaka Festival were purchased as souvenirs of the occasion. The Binzasara is a ritual dance related to agriculture and fertility performed during the month of May. Agricultural deities are addressed by the use of flowered hats and binzasara clappers.
Plaque,19th Century,United States,Ceramics,"John Bennett was trained in England. He seems to have played a crucial role there by introducing painted decoration on ceramics at the Doulton factory in the early 1870s. Although they admired his talent, his English colleagues found Bennett had a difficult personality, and his stay at the Doulton factory was brief. By 1876 he was in New York, bringing with him the concepts of the English Aesthetic Movement: muted colors and great naturalism in the depiction of birds and flowers."
Greek Vase with Yellow Plums and Carolina Parrot,21st Century,United States,Print,"Jane Hammond searches through bookshops and flea markets in search of printed material including manuals, scientific texts, stamps, cards, and cartoons. She assembles these varied elements adding examples of her own printmaking to construct collages with layers of meaning and new narratives. Greek Vase with Yellow Plums and Carolina Parrot is bursting with flowers gathered from the artist’s supply of source material, including antique botanical prints, but closer inspection also reveals animals and insects amid the foliage, lending the work a much more complicated and ambiguous character."
Plantae et Papiliones rariores:  Martynia,18th Century,Germany,Print,"Georg Ehret met Carolus Linnaeus in 1736. The dominant botanical artist in the mid-18th century, Ehret settled in England where the nobility clamored to receive his instruction. He commented in his autobiography, “If I could have divided myself into twenty parts I could still have had my hands full.” Ehret struck a fine compromise between the artist and the scientist. “While he did not slavishly imitate what he saw, neither did he allow his feeling for the color and design of flowers distract him from the fundamentals of plant structure,” confirms Wilfrid Blunt, author of The Art of Botanical Illustration. Ehret’s crisp forms betray a sureness of touch, vigor of handling, and unerring instinct for design."
Hollyhock Garden,20th Century,United States,Drawing,"Baumann began Hollyhock Garden around 1914 when living in Brown County, Indiana. After settling in Santa Fe, he reworked the scene in about 1919, adding Southwestern touches, such as transforming the wooden Indiana farmhouse with a shingle roof into adobe buildings with tile roofs. He must have referenced Hollyhock Garden in 1927 when making the color woodcut Hoosier Garden, since there are many correspondences between them, including the picket fence with its profusion of yellow and orange flowers and the porch chair, which lurks ghostlike beneath a thin layer of paint in the drawing."
Headpiece,10th - 12th Century,Null,Embroidery,"Pair of Headpieces Embroidery; silk Liao Dynasty (907-1125) The Cleveland Museum of Art, Gift of Lisbet Holmes 1995.109.a and 1995.109.b (Cat. no. 52) These headpieces are embroidered with butterflies, birds, animals, flowers, leaves, and delicate vine scrolls. In general, the design is related to the theme of the lotus pond, best known from Liao tomb paintings. Paired ducks or geese swimming in water and looking in opposite directions seem to have become popular in the north of China before spreading further south and to Central Asia. On the other hand, recumbent animals looking back are a Central Asian image that migrated to northern China.

Large Jar with Peonies and Chrysanthemums,17th Century,Null,Ceramics,"Japan took China’s place as Europe’s main source for export porcelain around the middle of the 17th century because the transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasty in China disrupted trade. The Dutch East India Company began to buy Japanese porcelain in 1650 and exported approximately 50,000 Japanese porcelains in 1659. Such large jars demonstrate how artists took the birds and flowers motifs found in paintings and applied them to the blue and white porcelain called sometsuke. The Japanese transformed typical Chinese Jingdezhen blue and white porcelain into a spacious composition. This design shows the changing of the seasons. One side depicts a peony blossom in the spring, and the other side continues with chrysanthemums and an orchid in the autumn."
Eagles,14th - 17th Century,Null,Painting,"Two eagles, painted in fine brushwork, perch on top of rocks surrounded by water, flowering camellia, and other vegetation, brushed in sweeping and broad strokes. Among birds, a favorite subject in Chinese painting, depictions of eagles can be traced back to at least the fourth century.Due to dramatic sociopolitical changes during the foreign-ruled Yuan (1279–1368) and native Ming dynasties, an elaborate symbolic language of the eagle developed. It can represent a vicious attacker, a courageous hero, or an enlightened emperor. In this painting, the two eagles are depicted peacefully resting in a lofty position, perhaps an idealistic image for a wise emperor and empress."
Southern Spring,20th Century,United States,Painting,"In 1943, the artist Hobson Pittman wrote to William M. Milliken, then director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, to express his pleasure that this work had been purchased by the museum. He explained that ""the canvas you have chosen...is one that I enjoyed painting very much indeed. It came after a visit with my family in North Carolina several years ago. I remember so well as I went down on the train, drinking in every bit of the landscape from the windows, noticing the flowering trees becoming fuller and fuller as I got nearer to my home. The yellow and reddish browns in the earth against the many tones and shades of greens and the blooming trees made me want to stop, then and there, and start painting. But that was not possible until my return. So from memory and imagination, the painting was done."""
The Immaculate Conception,18th Century,Germany,Sculpture,"This work has been associated with Johann Pieter Wagner, one of the leading Austrian sculptors of the second half of the 18th century.   Because of its small size, it was most likely either a model for a larger altarpiece or an object designed for private devotion. Gold serves as celestial decoration around the border and on the figures. The Virgin Mary stands upon billowing clouds held up by angels, a variant on the Madonna of Victory, which features Mary or Jesus holding a spear. Mary holds the infant Jesus, while trampling a serpent-symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. The holy child holds a bouquet of flowers, representing his ability to bestow grace, expressing the benevolence associated with the cult of the Immaculate Conception."
Stems,20th Century,United States,Photograph,"For more than forty years, Lee Friedlander has created ""social landscapes,"" images of jazz musicians, monuments, city streets, suburban backyards, and factory workers. Yet his portraits of family and friends, nudes, and still lifes demonstrate his versatility. This photograph, depicting the stems of cut flowers in a reflective glass bowl, comes from a series that Friedlander made while recovering from knee surgery. Through his keen powers of observation and conceptualization, he transformed the stems into a striking abstract composition of bold geometric forms, bathed in warm, atmospheric light. Aspects of the photographer's distinctive style-a close-up viewpoint, foreshortening, compressed space, and layering-appear in this work."
Love in the Elysian Fields,16th Century,Italy,Print,"In this engraving Cupid is shown being punished by those he tormented, a popular subject of Hellenistic art and literature revived in the Renaissance. Bound to a tree in the Elysian Fields, a dwelling place for the virtuous dead, Cupid is watched by the laughing souls of lovers as Venus descends from the sky to beat him with a bouquet of flowers in retribution for the great pain that passion often inflicts. According to the verses on the rock at left, after being whipped Cupid will be set free to escape again ""to this world where he triumphs over us."""
"Text, Folio 57 (recto), from a Kalpa-sutra",15th Century,Null,Painting,"The founder of Jainism, Mahavira, had 11 main disciples, all depicted as identical to one another. They all sit in a meditative posture, with the left hand in the lap, while the right hand is in the gesture of teaching. They each have shaven heads, elongated earlobes, and white robes, indicating that this manuscript was used by the Shvetambara (White Clad) sect. In the upper central grid, decorated with flowers, is a stylized om-hrim, mystic syllables visually combined to invoke the essence of all Jain teaching."
Headpiece,10th - 12th Century,Null,Embroidery,"These headpieces are embroidered with butterflies, birds, animals, flowers, leaves, and delicate vine scrolls. In general, the design is related to the theme of the lotus pond, best known from Liao tomb paintings.

Honeysuckle,20th Century,England,Textile,"William Morris’s daughter May called Honeysuckle “the most truly Morrisian in character of all his pattern-making . . . the most mysterious and poetic—the very symbol of a garden tangle.” Like many Morris textiles from this period, Honeysuckle has a mirrored pattern. At 29 3/4 inches high and 34 3/4 inches wide, this repeat was unusually broad, spanning almost the entire width of the loom. Morris believed that large patterns were more restful to the eye than small patterns, even when used to decorate modestly sized rooms. Designs from this period are a testament to the delight he took in his garden at Kelmscott Manor; he favored the charm of native English flowers above exotic specimens."
Paintings after Ancient Masters: Calligraphy,16th Century,China,Painting,"The twenty paintings in this double-album by Chen Hongshou include landscapes, figures, and flowers. It also has one leaf featuring a woman, an often-used subject not found in the other albums from the latter part of his career. His late works are wonderful summations of Chen's peculiar and quirky art--archaistic, hyper-refined--but without accompanying shallowness or sentimentality.His figures and landscapes in the late albums are miniaturized, not unlike the small Chinese gardens, or the carefully selected small table rocks or old roots used for contemplation to see the world in miniature. This loss of scale is quite deliberate and reflects the psychological situation of a depressed class like the Ming loyalist officials and scholars, deprived of their integrity and honor, and forced to lead a diminished and restricted existence."
Briar Rose (Dornröschen),19th Century,Germany,Print,"Fairy tales, folklore, and legends were understood as an important aspect of national and cultural heritage in 19th-century Germany. The interest in folk tales began as a literary phenomenon, but it soon infiltrated the visual arts. In his paintings and prints, Neureuther illustrated fairy tales and ballads of the period. In Grimm’s fairy tale ""Briar Rose,"" a princess and her kingdom are condemned to 100 years of sleep. According to the story, around the palace grew a thick hedge of briars, which every year grew higher until the castle was hidden from view. The duration of their sleep is suggested by the decorative border of wild flowers and vines that encroaches upon the castle."
Paintings after Ancient Masters: Autumn Landscape,16th Century,China,Painting,"The twenty paintings in this double album by Chen Hongshou include landscapes, figures, and flowers.

"Sakhi Persuades Radha to Meet Krishna, from a Gita Govinda (Song of the Cowherd) of Jayadeva",19th Century,India,Painting,"While all the cowherd girls were in love with Krishna, he had a favorite according to texts of the 1200s and later. Her name was Radha, and she and Krishna would meet for secret trysts in the forest, facilitated by her sakhi, or confidante. Krishna is shown twice in this painting. At the right he is in the process of making a bed of leaves for their upcoming encounter, and in the middle, he spies on Radha, wearing orange and gold. The sakhi is encouraging Radha to go and meet Krishna, since he is pining for her."
Four Petunias,20th Century,United States,Print,"With the advent of World War I, Blanche Lazzell and many other American artists returned home from Paris, where they had gone to study and work. In the summer of 1915, Lazzell moved to Provincetown, Massachusetts, on the tip of Cape Cod, to join several friends who had settled in this picturesque locale to experiment with their art. Influenced by Japanese color woodcuts (ukiyo-e), many of the artists were interested in producing woodcuts themselves. Lazzell's home and studio, built on a pier, could be recognized by its colorful displays of flowers grown from seeds in pots or started on climbing vines. A passionate gardener, many of her woodcuts depict brilliantly colored floral images. Although she made a small number of monotypes, these too reflect her continuous interest in botanical subjects."
Wall Hanging,19th Century,Null,Embroidery,"Embroideries known as suzani, after the Persian and Tajik word for needle (suzan), feature bold floral and foliate motifs enriched with several shades of red and crimson silk thread. This example suggests a lush garden enriched with single flowering plants alternating with a bird’s-eye view of blossoms in a foliate diamond trellis. Either a skilled family member or a professional drew the pattern in black ink (still visible) on five loosely joined cotton cloths; female family members disassembled them for stitching and reassembled them upon completion. Suzanis were made in many towns, generally with distinctive artistic and technical characteristics."
Front of the New Mills,19th Century,England,Print,"Crome's work epitomizes the essence of British landscape art at the beginning of the 19th century, the moment of its greatest flowering. Rooted in an almost mystical commmunion with nature, the artist's purpose was to express the true naturalism of landscape, a realism of light, air, and weather not seen before. He became interested in etching because he understood its potential for spontaneity, yet he feared his etchings would not be admired because they were, by conventional standards, unfinished and sketchy. In fact, it is precisely the freedom of line, lack of rigidity, and open silvery quality of light that makes them so special and individual. Rather than using prints to just copy his paintings, Crome approached etching as a creative medium with which to capture the special beauty of his native Norwich countryside. It is in early impressions like this one, printed by Crome in small numbers, and now extremely rare, that the delicacy of his technique can be appreciated."
Our Lady of Good Counsel,17th Century,Spain,Painting,"This painting loosely and inventively depicts an actual chapel in the former Jesuit Imperial College in Madrid, which housed a Madonna and Child in gilded and painted wood, a focus of popular devotion. Pérez made temporary decorations for the Spanish court, none of which survive, but the fanciful architecture, curiously inverted obelisks, fruits and flowers, and pastel colors all stem from this side of his work. By representing a polychrome sculpture in two dimensions, Pérez further blurred boundaries between painting and sculpture. This intersection of the spiritual and the real worlds was important in Spanish art of the 1600s."
Untitled (portraits in palms with henna),20th Century,Null,Photograph,"Two hands of a bride, with a ring on every finger and vegetal patterns drawn in henna, offer superimposed photographic images of a man and woman––probably the bride and groom––as though they are gifts of coins or flowers to the viewer. Their beautiful faces stand for the auspiciousness that their marriage and wealth imply. Jewelry and fancy textiles are seen in the background, colored with a translucent tint of turquoise blue. This color is associated in Muslim circles with paradise, but the groom’s tilak, a mark on the forehead, indicates that he is Hindu."
Phoenixes and Paulownia,16th Century,Japan,Painting,"The immense heraldic birds on display in these byøbu reflect the Momoyama era's spirit of newly gained self-confidence and an affinity for grand expressive statements in painting, architecture, the textile and ceramic arts, as well as garden design. While that period preceded the arrival of prosperity, it clearly marked an extra---ordinary moment in Japanese cultural history, one frequently compared with the twelfth century of the Heian period. Through the extensive use of gold-foil backgrounds rather than the somber palette of carefully orchestrated ink tones evident in Muromachi byøbu, patrons colla-borated with artists as well as craftsmen in fostering a decidedly new look in much of Japanese painting. Here for instance there is no imaginary vista suggesting China's vast waterways and mountain ranges. The setting is composed instead of highly stylized lozenges of mineral green paint, suggesting the earth from which clumps of grass, flowering plants, and towering bamboo and paulownia trees emerge. Clusters of lumpy, blue-green rocks dotted with lichen provide stabilizing three-dimensional foils for these islands of vegetation as well as the all-encompassing flat, golden surface. The glorious artificiality of the setting precisely serves the artist's effort to compose a credible yet other-worldly vista for depicting the legendary phoenix gazing across the landscape at the pair of peacocks. Rather than an emblem of immortality, as it is in Western lore, in Japan the phoenix evolved out of its origins in Chinese mythology to become, by the sixteenth century, an auspicious symbol of political authority. Together with clusters of the distinctively shaped paulownia leaves, this long-tailed, mythical bird graced lacquerware as well as mural paintings, proclaiming an air of graceful com-mand. A characteristic infusion of temporality has been included also, through a seasonal flowering schema extending from spring to early summer (right) to fall and the advent of winter (left). Although traditionally attributed to the Tosa school master Tosa Mitsuyoshi (1539-1613), these byøbu possess neither seals nor signatures to confirm that authorship. Known for his jewel-like, modest-sized album paintings of courtly narratives such as The Tale of Genji, it is likely both studio training and contemporary fashions in patronage conspired to produce a good number of such byøbu. This example from the Momoyama era represents one such effort from a masterful Tosa painter, too little seen in Western collections."

In the Forest,19th Century,France,Painting,"With its beautifully rendered trees, grassy slopes, and water bathed in late afternoon sunlight, this painting clearly suggests Nanteuil's love of nature. In 1837 he wrote to a friend: ""I often spend several hours . . . looking at beautiful plants with large leaves, cut out like sumptuous lace, tall grasses in ponds, their color silky and the beautiful reflections they make in the water, the little flowers with thousands of colours the ground is embroidered with, all provide me with a source of enjoyment."" Although the forest Nanteuil described seems very real, his painting includes a satyr. Seated on a stone near a stream, the half human, half goat mythological figure seems lost in the music he plays upon his pipes. Nanteuil is most famous for his lithographs and etchings; paintings by the artist are rather rare."
The Courtesan Hanamurasaki of the Tsuchiya (from the series Beauties in their Finery amid Mallow Flowers),19th Century,Japan,Print,
Brocaded velvet with medallions in ogival lattice,16th Century,Null,Velvet,"This luxurious velvet is similar to fabrics worn by Turkish sultans on elaborate ceremonial occasions at the imperial Topkapi Palace in Istanbul during the 1500s. Such bold patterns and high quality served to symbolize the immense power and unfathomable wealth of the Ottoman Empire. The design in this velvet was adapted from Ottoman court art and assembled to create lively contrasts between large motifs that can be seen from a distance—medallion and lattice—and small designs that can only be admired up close—flowers and crowns. Only the latter was of foreign, Italian, origin. The velvet was probably used as an upholstery fabric, seamed to several identical lengths, to form an opulent cover for a divan (sofa) at the palace."
Portrait of Samuel Butler,18th Century,England,Portrait Miniature,"Bernard Lens III was the most renowned member of an artist dynasty. His namesake father was a printmaker, his grandfather a painter, and two of his own sons became artists. Lens III was a critical figure in miniature painting as the art form transitioned away from painting on vellum. During the first decade of the eighteenth century, he established ivory as the primary miniature support in Britain, probably having seen the pioneering work of Rosalba Carriera (1675–1757) brought to England from Venice during the flowering of the Grand Tour. The earliest known miniatures by Lens were painted on vellum around 1707, with examples on ivory appearing shortly thereafter. Lens spent his career in London, Bristol, and Bath while also traveling to the country estates of his influential patrons. He was painter to kings George I and George II, as well as drawing instructor to princesses Mary and Louise, the Duke of Cumberland, and Horace Walpole (1717–1797).The sitter, Samuel Butler, turns slightly to the left and has brown eyes. A small portion of his dull red coat is visible, and he wears a white lace cravat twisted around his neck in a loose knot—an essential element of a gentleman’s dress that was fashionable between the 1670s and 1690s and unlike the broad lace or linen collars that dominated in the early and mid-seventeenth century. A long, brown, curled wig falls past his shoulders, and one comma-shaped curl is arranged at the center of his forehead. Butler’s voluminous wig occupies half of the painted surface. During the 1660s gentlemen regularly wore wigs, and while they offered a practical solution to such predicaments as hair loss, graying, and lice, wigs were subject to the vicissitudes of fashion. The wig style seen here is that of the late seventeenth century. Around 1680 it became the norm to part the long wig at the center, which by 1700 resulted in two pronounced tufts on either side, a style not yet exhibited in this portrait.Butler was a poet and satirist popular at the court of King Charles II (reigned 1660–1685). He is primarily remembered as the author of Hudibras, a mock-heroic epic poem satirizing Puritanism written during the English civil war and published between 1663 and 1678."
Paintings after Ancient Masters: Daoist and Crane in Autumn Landscape,16th Century,China,Painting,"The twenty paintings in this double-album by Chen Hongshou include landscapes, figures, and flowers. It also has one leaf featuring a woman, an often-used subject not found in the other albums from the latter part of his career. His late works are wonderful summations of Chen's peculiar and quirky art--archaistic, hyper-refined--but without accompanying shallowness or sentimentality.His figures and landscapes in the late albums are miniaturized, not unlike the small Chinese gardens, or the carefully selected small table rocks or old roots used for contemplation to see the world in miniature. This loss of scale is quite deliberate and reflects the psychological situation of a depressed class like the Ming loyalist officials and scholars, deprived of their integrity and honor, and forced to lead a diminished and restricted existence."

Spring New Mexico,20th Century,United States,Print,"Baumann was attracted to the crystalline light and mountain scenery of the Southwest. He was always searching for novel subject matter, like the adobe architecture and flowering trees in Spring New Mexico, and was enticed since “all of the Southwest was virgin territory to the artist.” Appreciating the cultural diversity that gave the area its special ambiance, Baumann noted about Santa Fe, “The town as a whole gave me the feeling of a fairly well-adjusted mixture of Spanish and Anglo culture, with the Indian as an interrupted civilization still pervading it all. It made for a unique situation not likely to be found anywhere else.”"
"The Eleven Principal Disciples (Ganadharas) of Mahavira, Folio 57 (verso), from a Kalpa-sutra",15th Century,Null,Painting,"The founder of Jainism, Mahavira, had 11 main disciples, all depicted as identical to one another. They all sit in a meditative posture, with the left hand in the lap, while the right hand is in the gesture of teaching. They each have shaven heads, elongated earlobes, and white robes, indicating that this manuscript was used by the Shvetambara (White Clad) sect. In the upper central grid, decorated with flowers, is a stylized om-hrim, mystic syllables visually combined to invoke the essence of all Jain teaching."

"Hours of Queen Isabella the Catholic, Queen of Spain:  Fol. 24v, Souls of the Saved Brought to Heaven",16th Century,Belgium,Books,"A great lover of Flemish art, Queen Isabella treasured her many devotional books. This deluxe manuscript was created for her private devotions by highly organized and distinctly talented manuscript painters active in Ghent and Bruges. The Ghent-Bruges school represents the culmination of Flemish book painting, whose main features were the use of rich colors, illusionistic effects, a love of landscape, and a strong sense of visual narrative. Manuscripts produced by this circle of artists are renowned for their border decoration featuring a rich variety of realistically painted flowers, scrolling acanthus leaves, birds, and butterflies."
Portrait of the Artist's Children Emma and Paul,18th Century,France,Portrait Miniature,"This sensitive depiction of his children exhibits Laurent's ability to portray the psychological interiority of his subjects, young or old. The miniature shows Laurent's son and daughter in white chemise gowns with green ribbon accents. They both have striking blue eyes and slightly curled blond hair. The younger sibling tenderly holds the arm of the older one, who sits on a chair strewn with pink rose petals and inscribed with the artist's signature. The children are placed within an environment in which green foliage sprouts small blue and purple flowers. This organic setting reflects 18th-century Western philosophies of natural child rearing, characterized by treating childhood as a period of innocence distinct from adulthood and advocating that children not be treated as miniature adults but instead should have their naiveté celebrated. This philosophy influenced children's clothing. Instead of dressing children as small adults in constrictive costumes, both genders wore loose chemises, like the ones seen here, that encouraged mobility."
Leaf from a Book of Hours: Office of the Dead: Angel Chasing a Devil (recto),15th Century,France,Manuscript,"The elaborate floral and foliated borders of this leaf, decorating the top, bottom, and sides of both recto and verso, contain four separate elements: blue and gold acanthus leaves, gold-leaf ivy vines, sprays of flowers or fruit, and a grotesque. Here the margin prominently includes an illuminated roundel with an angel chasing a devil with a lance. As a time-saving device, illuminators in the 1450s and later would often paint identical borders on both sides of a leaf. The motifs would be drawn on one side and then traced on the other by holding the leaf against a window. The manuscript from which this leaf came is no longer intact. It included numerous painted roundels relating to the lives of Saint Catherine of Alexandria and the more obscure Saint Alexis. It is possible that the manuscript originally belonged to a married couple for whom these saints served as patrons."

Leaf from a Psalter and Prayerbook: Calendar Page with Labors (recto),16th Century,Null,Manuscript,"These three leaves represent the charming, intricate decoration found throughout the parent volume, its leaves now dispersed. Virtually every border, recto and verso, was decorated with liquid gold and highlighted with a variety of flowers, fruits, and vegetables—carnations, thistles, roses, violets, peas, melons—as well as cornucopias, satyrs, masks, insects, birds, etc. The decoration is particularly charming because of the little vignettes within the borders. These motifs depict a girl kneading bread, a cook ladling soup, a goose nibbling grapes off a vine, and a satyr with a horn. Such details would have been a sumptuous delight to the original owner. This was a highly personalized volume, apparently written and illuminated in North Germany. The prominent mention of Saint Godehard (died 1038), Bishop of Hildesheim, in the original manuscript suggests that it was produced in that city."

"Full Moon on Kanazawa, Musashi",19th Century,Japan,Print,"Late in his career, Hiroshige explored the poetic theme of setsugekka, “snow, moon, and flowers,” in a set of three triptychs. This panoramic scene shows the autumn moon over Kanazawa, near Tokyo. Hiroshige’s contemporaries would have recognized the coastline dotted with villages, fishing boats, and the distinctive double-arched bridge at the bottom right."
Prince's trousers and lining,8th Century,Null,Garment,"This coat and pants are part of a set of garments that originally included an outer pair of pants and silk boots made from the same material as the coat. The cut of the coat suggests that the set belonged to a little boy. Such rich garments would have been worn by a member of the imperial family or nobility. The fabrics comprising this outfit were woven in widely distant parts of Asia. The silk of the coat, with ducks in pearl roundels, was woven in Sogdiana. The white silk of the pants, ornamented with flowers and birds, is Chinese. Both garments are lined with a Chinese silk woven with a radial floral pattern that was common during the 8th century. The coat and pants were made at a time when Tibetan power extended to parts of China, eastern Central Asia, and the trade routes to Sogdiana."

Nymphéa,20th Century,France,Photograph,"A prolific Parisian artist who enjoyed a three-decade career, Atget was one of the most important and original photographers active at the beginning of the 20th century. This sparkling landscape of a mass of white water lily blossoms (Nymphéa) is among Atget's best compositions, created in the 1920s, when he was at the height of his artistic prowess. This scene, full of luxurious botany, was probably taken in Bagatelle Park at the edge of Paris's Bois de Boulogne. He carefully focused on the floating plants and their sculptured flowers, detailing texture and shape. The early morning illumination created light and shadow patterns that enabled Atget to isolate flat, abstracted forms while simultaneously depicting a deep pictorial space. In this lush, purplish print, the lily pond shimmers with reflected shadows and brilliant highlights."
Sun Bathing (verso),20th Century,United States,Woodblock,"Mabel Hewit, a Cleveland artist, learned the technique of the white line woodcut from Blanche Lazzell. Unlike Lazzell who favored images of Provincetown, flowers, or boats, Hewit chose to represent figures in everyday scenes in her own personal style. To print the image, a sheet of paper is tacked to one corner of the woodblock. Noncontiguous areas on the block are colored, often with watercolor, and the paper laid across the block. The back of the sheet of paper is rubbed, transferring the color to the paper. The groove cut into the block is not inked, so that the white of the paper acts as an outline around the colored shapes. If the pressure of the printing is strong, the white lines are embossed, or raised, on the surface of the paper. The white line accentuates the underlying linear structure of the print which strengthens the conception and unifies the composition."

Shri Raga: An Illustration from a Ragamala Series,18th Century,Null,Painting,"The verse associated with Shri Raga corresponds closely with this scene:   His body, bluish in hue, is marvelously built.  He is always graced with the company of auspicious Shri Lakshmi.  He sits on a throne of gold, and before him Narada sits playing on his vina.  He has decorated himself with garlands of flowers, and also with ornaments set with jewels.  Shri raga is thus conceived in sentiment, of whom all learned men sing praises. The horse-headed figure claps his hands and accompanies the sage, wearing saffron garments and playing on the stringed instrument called a vina. He may be derived from the courtly commander of Indra, seen in the Jain manuscripts. Poppies bloom in the formal garden below the pure white terrace, and they are echoed by the oranges set on the windows of the house at the upper right."

His late works are wonderful summations of Chen's peculiar and quirky art--archaistic, hyper-refined--but without accompanying shallowness or sentimentality.His figures and landscapes in the late albums are miniaturized, not unlike the small Chinese gardens, or the carefully selected small table rocks or old roots used for contemplation to see the world in miniature. This loss of scale is quite deliberate and reflects the psychological situation of a depressed class like the Ming loyalist officials and scholars, deprived of their integrity and honor, and forced to lead a diminished and restricted existence."

"Hours of Queen Isabella the Catholic, Queen of Spain:  Fol. 72v, Crucifixion",16th Century,Belgium,Books,"This manuscript was illuminated by a circle of at least five highly organized manuscript painters active in the Flemish cities of Ghent and Bruges. The principal illuminator was Alexander Bening, who painted the majority of the book's miniatures. Manuscripts produced by this circle of artists are renowned for the decoration of their borders, which typically feature a rich variety of realistically-painted flowers, birds, and butterflies. This prayer book, called a book of hours, was intended not for a cleric, but for the private devotions of a lay person-in this case, Isabella the Catholic, Queen of Spain (1451-1504). Isabella's coat of arms embellishes the book's frontispiece. It is unlikely that the book was commissioned by the Queen herself; rather, she probably received it as a diplomatic gift from someone courting her patronage, perhaps Cardinal Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros. A Franciscan friar, Jimenez was dependent upon Isabella for his advancement, first to the post of Queen's confessor in 1492, and then to Archbishop of Toledo in 1495."
Leaf from a Book of Hours: Office of the Dead: Two Devils (verso),15th Century,France,Manuscript,"As a time-saving device, illuminators in the 1450s and later would often paint identical borders on both sides of a leaf. The motifs would be drawn on one side and then traced on the other by holding the leaf against a window. Both sides of this leaf are therefore mirror images, containing elaborate floral borders, gold-leaf ivy vines, sprays of flowers or fruit, and a grotesque, in this case a bird with the head of a man. Also included is a roundel featuring two devils. This leaf is from a dismantled manuscript that included numerous painted roundels relating to the lives of Saint Catherine of Alexandria and the more obscure Saint Alexis."

Leaf from a Book of Hours: Office of the Dead: Angel Chasing a Devil (recto) and Two Devils (verso),15th Century,France,Manuscript,"The elaborate floral and foliated borders of this leaf, decorating the top, bottom, and sides of both recto and verso, contain four separate elements: blue and gold acanthus leaves, gold-leaf ivy vines, sprays of flowers or fruit, and a grotesque. Here the margin prominently includes an illuminated roundel with an angel chasing a devil with a lance. As a time-saving device, illuminators in the 1450s and later would often paint identical borders on both sides of a leaf. The motifs would be drawn on one side and then traced on the other by holding the leaf against a window. The manuscript from which this leaf came is no longer intact. It included numerous painted roundels relating to the lives of Saint Catherine of Alexandria and the more obscure Saint Alexis. It is possible that the manuscript originally belonged to a married couple for whom these saints served as patrons."
Portrait of the Artist's Children Emma and Paul,18th Century,France,Portrait Miniature,"This sensitive depiction of his children exhibits Laurent's ability to portray the psychological interiority of his subjects, young or old. The miniature shows Laurent's son and daughter in white chemise gowns with green ribbon accents. They both have striking blue eyes and slightly curled blond hair. The younger sibling tenderly holds the arm of the older one, who sits on a chair strewn with pink rose petals and inscribed with the artist's signature. The children are placed within an environment in which green foliage sprouts small blue and purple flowers. This organic setting reflects 18th-century Western philosophies of natural child rearing, characterized by treating childhood as a period of innocence distinct from adulthood and advocating that children not be treated as miniature adults but instead should have their naiveté celebrated. This philosophy influenced children's clothing. Instead of dressing children as small adults in constrictive costumes, both genders wore loose chemises, like the ones seen here, that encouraged mobility."

Cutting from a Missal: Initial O with Christ Performing an Exorcism,16th Century,Italy,Manuscript,"This initial is probably the O beginning the Introit for the Third Sunday in Lent, Occuli mei semper ad Dominum (My eyes are ever towards the Lord). The Gospel reading from that Sunday tells the story of Christ casting out a demon. The artist's style is easily recognized in the facial features, and in the borders, in which he typically mixed still-life motifs, scattered small red and blue flowers, strawberries, and simulated pearls and jewels. Matteo's life dates are not known. His career probably began in Milan in the 1490s, but his name occurs in the accounts of the d'Este family at Ferrara from 1502 to 1512. The climax of Matteo's career was his activity in Rome, where he was apparently responsible for a number of luxury illuminated liturgical manuscripts. In 1520 he illuminated a missal for Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, the future Pope Clement VII (1523–34). The initial shown here comes from another missal that he must have illuminated around the same time. This missal was most probably in the Sistine Chapel sacristy when it was sacked by Napoleon's troops in 1798."

Single Leaf with Scenes from the Last Supper,16th Century,Belgium,Manuscript,"Born either in Ghent or Antwerp in 1483, Simon Bening became one of the most famous manuscript painters of the 1500s. He was the son of the miniaturist Alexander Bening. His long career in Bruges, where he worked from 1508 until 1555, was distinguished by a series of major commissions for celebrated families. This illuminated leaf, one of 11 preserved from the now lost parent manuscript, was painted for a member of the important Spanish family of Enriquez de Ribera, whose coat of arms appears at the bottom of the miniature. The incident, shown in the upper register, during which Jesus gives a piece of bread to Judas (dressed in yellow and green) to indicate his knowledge of his betrayal, is depicted primarily according to the Gospel of John (13:21–30). In the lower register, Judas, realizing that his betrayal is understood, gets up suddenly to leave. His wooden stool topples over, and Christ’s words appear in a banderole: Quod facis fac cito (""What thou doest, do quickly,"" John 13:27). The two scenes are surrounded by an illusionistic border in liquid silver, with liquid gold acanthus, butterflies, and flowers. In the upper left of the border is the evangelist Matthew."

A Franciscan friar, Jimenez was dependent upon Isabella for his advancement, first to the post of Queen's confessor in 1492, and then to Archbishop of Toledo in 1495."
