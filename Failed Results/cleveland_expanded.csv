Flower Study of a Lily of the Valley,"Russia, St. Petersburg","DescriptionThis flower study resembles a stem of lily-of-the-valley. Fabergé’s inspiration for his flower studies is said to have come from the floral brooches of precious stones that were made in the 1700s for Catherine the Great as well as from the Japanese art of flower arranging, known as ikebana. Small and delicate, Fabergé’s flower studies were given as intimate gifts to friends by the tsarina and others in the court.

White Flower,"America, 20th century","DescriptionO’Keeffe is best known for close-up flower subjects whose magnified forms fill the entire space of each canvas. Likely inspired by similar compositions in modern photography, these images are not only celebrations of natural forms, but also striking essays in abstract design. Although many critics interpreted O’Keeffe’s flower paintings as reflections of femininity in general and female sexuality in particular, the artist strongly opposed such readings. Throughout most of her career, she frequently attempted to persuade others to discuss her work without referring to her gender, writing on one occasion, “I have always been very annoyed at being referred to as a ‘woman artist’ rather than an ‘artist.’”",Type of artwork: Painting

"The Marsh Flower, a Sad Human Head","France, 19th century","DescriptionThis series is one of many that Odilon Redon created throughout his career. Nearly two-thirds of his lithographs took the form of portfolios—prints connected conceptually by a theme or narrative and physically by a folder or binding. Such works were often dispersed over time, but Cleveland was fortunate to acquire several complete sets with their original covers during the 1920s. Dating from Redon’s early experimentation with lithography, Homage to Goya was intended as a tribute to 18th-century Spanish master Francisco de Goya, whose interest in dreams and the subconscious influenced Redon. The six seemingly unrelated images celebrate Goya’s ambiguity and collectively suggest the introspection and isolation of artistic practice.",Type of artwork: Print
Vase with flower arrangement and scrollwork,,"DescriptionThe symmetry of the floral arrangement emerging from the blue-and-white porcelain vase reveals an idealized vision. The overflowing vase is among the most ancient motifs in Indian art, used to convey the concept of abundance. This image, made for an elite patron of northern India, implies the prosperity that has accrued from international connections. The vase, painted with a European-style landscape, is of the type that was made in China for export to Europe. The scrolling ornament on either side may be ultimately derived from Persian motifs, but reworked into a European style, painted by Indian artists.",Type of artwork: Painting
Flowers in a Glass,Netherlands,"DescriptionOne of the first artists to specialize in flower painting, Ambrosius Bosschaert may have been inspired by the botanical gardens and scientific collections in his hometown of Middelburg. The flowers in this bouquet might be common today, but in the 1600s they were costly rarities. Bosschaert captured their fragile beauty with luminous colors and exquisite detail.",Type of artwork: Painting
Flower Stand (Jardinière),"France, early 19th Century","DescriptionThomire was the most productive and famous bronze caster in Paris around 1800.

Vase of Flowers,"France, 20th century","DescriptionInspired by Cleveland’s groundbreaking acquisitions of Odilon Redon’s artworks during the 1920s, local philanthropist and collector Leonard C. Hanna Jr. purchased this luminous pastel of a floral still life in 1937. Hanna acquired it from Jacques Seligmann, a dealer based in New York City and Paris who was fundamental in bringing 19th-century French art to American audiences. In 1939, Hanna loaned the pastel to the New York World’s Fair, where it represented Redon’s work. Those who saw it there were attracted to the vivid color and timeless subject, which preoccupied the artist at the end of his life.",Type of artwork: Drawing
Flower-shaped Mirror,,"DescriptionFrom ancient times, a mirror assumed various roles; a ritualistic tool, a diplomatic gift, and a luxury commodity. During the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392), which saw the great advancement of metallurgy, the royal court was the center of distributing sophisticated bronze artifacts. According to historical records, on the 7th day of the Lunar New Year, the king bestowed a bronze mirror inscribed with auspicious symbols upon each court official as part of a ceremony to celebrate the Day of Humans.

Flower Vase with Chrysanthemums,"Japan, Meiji period","DescriptionSeifū Yohei III (1851–1914) was a son of the Maruyama school painter Okada Ryōhei (dates unknown). Though he studied painting, he ultimately succeeded his ceramics mentor, Seifū Yohei II (1845–1878), in Kyoto. He distinguished himself as a remarkable porcelain artist, taking Qing dynasty Chinese wares as his inspiration. He experimented widely with new glazing techniques.

Plate with Bird and Flower,,"DescriptionThis dish is a sophisticated example of later ceramists reinterpreting earlier styles of Japanese porcelain. The colors and patterns used look similar to some works produced on the island of Kyushu in the1600s and 1700s. However, the idea to combine alternating blocks of yellow, green, purple, and blue with a ""Chinese grasses"" (karakusa) pattern around the rim of the dish is one hit upon in the early 1900s by an artist familiar with the colors and patterns of earlier works.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
Covent Garden Flower Women,"England, 19th century","DescriptionThomson’s collaborator, reporter Adolphe Smith said that “The familiar sight of a poor woman holding a pale child in her arms and offering modest violets to the pedestrian, is pregnant with a poetry which rags, and dirt fail to obliterate.” The jobs, which were passed down between generations, required worked long hours and yielded a meager income.",Type of artwork: Photograph
Vase of Flowers,"France, late 19th-early 20th Century","DescriptionKnown for his dark, velvety charcoal drawings and lithographs, Redon began working predominantly in oil and pastel after 1900, thus enlisting color in his explorations of the world of dreams and the imagination. Like other Symbolists, Redon searched for alternative experiences beyond the rational logic of Naturalism and Impressionism. He used his knowledge of botany as a starting point for this painting, but infused the flowers with heightened luminosity and sensuous form.",Type of artwork: Painting
Flower Vase,"France, 16th century","DescriptionMade as two separate elements, this extremely rare example of Saint-Porchaire ware may have been conceived primarily as a tour de force of decorative art.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
A Young Woman Buying a Pink from a Young Man,"Italy, Venice, 18th century","DescriptionGiovanni Battista Piazzetta was celebrated for his finished drawings of saints, portraits, and teste di carattere (character heads). Cleveland’s sheet belongs to the latter genre, which describes portraits embellished with props to suggest a character type or types. Here, Piazzetta united three independent studies of individuals into a single scene, in which a young woman appears to purchase a pink—a type of flower related to the carnation—from a boy with a second young woman looking on.The image bristles with tantalizing narrative potential, but it is left to the viewer to interpret the scene as they wish. Drawings of this size and quality of finish were displayed on walls like paintings, rather than stored in portfolios, with the unfortunate consequence that the Venetian blue paper often faded to a grayish-tan as here. However, the virtuosity of Piazzetta’s technique endures on this sheet. His method of modeling—wetting and rubbing his black crayon rather than hatching—produces the density of tone and velvety shadow. Textural details are supplied by white chalk, evoking the silky weave of the boy’s shirt and the hard substance of the figures’ fingernails. Piazzetta's drawings were in high demand among affluent foreign visitors and helped to supplement his income.",Type of artwork: Drawing
Still Life: Bouquet of Flowers Emerging from the Grass,,"DescriptionStudies of flower arrangements in the European manner became a popular subject in Indian miniature painting during the reign of Mughal emperor Jahangir (reigned 1605–27).

Here, in a painting made at a Rajasthani court, the entire bouquet grows magically out of the ground from a single stem.",Type of artwork: Painting
Spring Flowers,"France, 19th century","DescriptionThis early work reveal's Monet's fascination with capturing the transitory effects that became the primary focus of his later innovations. Painted with almost scientific accuracy, this still life has a freshness and immediacy derived partly from its composition. Isolated against a dark background, the fully mature peonies, potted hydrangeas, and basketed lilacs spill downward and outward from the geraniums at the rear. At the same time, Monet's energetic brushwork conveys the sparkling play of light on leaves and petals.",Type of artwork: Painting
Flower Vase with Phoenix in Paulownia,"Japan, Meiji period","DescriptionOne of Seifū Yohei III’s most visually impactful techniques, seen in this work, was to combine complex low-relief designs in clay surrounded by diffused underglaze blue or pink, which he then covered with a transparent or translucent glaze. Yohei III also experimented with clay bodies ranging from bluish white to ivory combined with translucent cream-colored glazes. The atmospheric effects he achieved were considered remarkable.",Type of artwork: Ceramic

Stater: Three-Petal Flower (obverse); Horse and wheels (reverse),,"DescriptionThe Iceni were a native tribe inhabiting Norfolk, Suffolk, and parts of Cambridgeshire. They were described by the Romans as powerful, unbroken by war. In AD 61 the king of the Iceni, Prasutagus, died, leaving his apparently considerable wealth to his two daughters and to the Roman Emperor, as joint heirs. However, while the Roman legions under Aulus Plautius were in Wales taking drastic steps to exterminate Druidism, Boadicea, the widow of Prasutagus, was ill-treated by the Romans and her two daughters were outraged. The Iceni rose in revolt and helped by their neighbors the Trinovantes, they overran the Roman settlements. It is said that 70,000 Romans were massacred at Camulodunum, and the Iceni, with Boadicea in a war chariot at their head, sacked and burned Verulamium (St. Albans, Hertfordshire), and London. Suetonius, one of the leading Roman generals, returned from the west with all possible speed and came up with the Iceni in the northwest of Roman London. Here a great battle was fought, resulting in a complete victory for the disciplined Roman forces; thousands of Britons were killed. The site of this battle is supposed to have been near what is now Kings Cross, in central London, commemorated by Battle Bridge Road.",Type of artwork: Coins
Vase with Bird and Flower Design,,"DescriptionThis vase with broad shoulders and a tall neck represents a typical style of 19th-century blue-and-white porcelain. Unlike earlier examples decorated mainly with literati themes that evoke neo-Confucian moral values—plum blossoms (purity), orchids (grace), bamboo (integrity), and chrysanthemums (loftiness)—porcelain works of the 1800s feature fully bloomed peonies and a pair of playful birds, symbols of wealth and familial harmony.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
Pair of Hexagonal Flower Pots,,"DescriptionThis deep hexagonal flowerpot, one of a pair in the collection, is numbered ""8"" and bears additional inscriptions to indicate specifically the location of its usage within the palace: ""for use in the Study of Illumination (Mingchuang yong)"" within the ""Hall of Cultivating the Mind (Yangxin Dian)"" of the Forbidden City. The inscriptions seem to suggest the Qing imperial provenance of this pair.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
Sandy and Her Husband,America,"DescriptionIn Sandy and Her Husband, the dancing couple at the center of the image is joined by Amos herself: the artist inserted herself into the picture by rendering an earlier self-portrait, Flower Sniffer (1966), which hangs on the wall behind the couple. However, even as Amos is part of the composition, she is peripheral to the scene, unseen or ignored by the dancers. From the early 1960s until her death in 2020, Amos made paintings, prints, and textiles celebrating African American identity and culture, and often exploring women’s presence within that heritage.",Type of artwork: Painting

Ink Flowers,"China, Yuan dynasty","DescriptionZhao Zhong's flowers, each paired with a poem, echo the fine-style colored flowers of the academic tradition, but instead he used only ink. Fine lines define the contours of each plant, as well as the veins within each petal and leaf. Careful ink washes give subtle modeling to the forms. The combination of lily, narcissus, and peony is unusual as the three belong to no known seasonal or symbolic system popular in the fourteenth century. Zhao’s medical training may have influenced the selection. Powdered lilies, for example, were prescribed to dispel grief, while the bark of tree peony roots was used as a treatment for various blood disorders.",Type of artwork: Painting
Bowl with Flower Petals,,"DescriptionYuan dynasty Shufu ware was a further development of the earlier qingbai ware and is characterized by a more heavily constructed body, opaque white glaze, molded decoration, and at times the inscription Shufu that gives the ware its name.

Flower Vase with Butterflies,"Japan, Meiji period","DescriptionKyoto-based Japanese ceramist Seifū Yohei III (1851–1914) admired the glaze colors found on Chinese porcelain and tried to replicate them through intensive experimentation. His green and creamy white glazes were particularly well received. The combinations of colors with subtle molded and incised decorations in his ceramics respond powerfully to changes in light, creating a dynamic viewing experience. Names for the glazes, written in ink with a brush on the lids of the custom-made storage boxes for the works, often indicate a specific glaze or ware that had inspired him, even when the resulting color was distinctively his own.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
Mirror with Six Circular Flowers,,"DescriptionAround the mirror’s central knob, there are six floral designs set within circles, separated by candelabra-like dividers. These flower designs later became known as ""baoxiang hua 寶相花"" or ""flowers of precious appearance"", which often remind people of Buddhist connections.

Jar with Bird and Flower Decoration,,"DescriptionJoseon blue-and-white porcelains were called “靑畫,"" meaning “painted in blue.” The blue here indicates cobalt pigment. In the 1700s, the royal court banned the importation of cobalt blue for its luxurious nature; thus, relatively few Joseon blue-and-white porcelain vessels were produced at that time. In that context, this modest-looking jar was considered to be a rare luxury.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
Mirror with Lotus and Mantra,,"DescriptionThis mirror features intricate Buddhist designs. Around the central knob are four leaves, a ring of tiny beads, and then a circle made up of small lotus flower designs. Outside of that are eight big petal shapes, inside each is a Sanskrit letter. The mirror has the phrase ""In the name of Om mani padme hum"" written in a slightly incorrect form of Sanskrit, possibly because the Chinese mirror maker was not familiar with the language.",Type of artwork: Metalwork

Flower Garden,"Japan, 20th century","DescriptionWatanabe is associated with the Japanese folk art movement
that admired traditional crafts, like stencil, for their
unpretentiousness. Here, Watanabe employed wrinkled
handmade paper, commonly used for book covers and
endpapers, to add texture to the broad areas of flat color and
to emphasize the rough, handcrafted quality of his prints.
The unsophisticated, folk-like images allude to early Japanese
Buddhist prints, in which black lines, rich color contrasts,

Watanabe often chose religious themes from the Bible.",Type of artwork: Print
Winter and Summer Flowers,"Japan, Momoyama period","DescriptionWhite camellias bloom behind a large pine in the right screen and blue morning glories creep through bamboo in the left screen of this composition.

The Blue Passion-flower,"England, late 18th-early 19th Century","DescriptionIn the 18th century, new engraving and etching techniques offered a variety of tonal effects that enhanced botanical prints. While mezzotint (in which the plate is roughened and then the engraver works from dark to light creating different values) and stipple (dots create values) make it possible to create the rich tonal scale and velvety texture of oil paint, aquatint imitates the delicacy and transparency of watercolor and ink wash.",Type of artwork: Print
Plate from Dessert Service: Nettle Leaved Bell Flower,"England, Derby, 18th century","DescriptionEach dish is decorated with recognizable plants, the names of which are inscribed on the base in both Latin and English. Identifying the blossoms only became customary in the late 18th century when a single piece of porcelain was decorated with one species, and flowers were represented along with leaves, stems, seed pods, and roots. All of this reflects Carolus Linnaeus’s recent invention of a scientific method to categorize all known flora. The decorations on the Derby factory’s products derive from contemporary English botanical publications. For instance, illustrations in William Curtis’s The Botanical Magazine served as models for the French marigold and nettle-leaved bell flower on the dessert service.",Type of artwork: Ceramic

Canopy with Dragon among Flowers,,"DescriptionThe tapestry sewn into the center of this canopy depicts dragons among flowers, a classic design in Chinese art. Its weavers paid attention to fine details, such as the color gradation of the dragon’s scales, or subtle color changes in the flower petals and leaves. The selection of colored silk threads is soft in tone but rich in variety. All these stylistic characteristics indicate that this tapestry was woven in an imperial Southern Song workshop in the capital of Hangzhou, a center of textile production in the Jiangnan region.",Type of artwork: Textile

Hollyhock-shaped Cup,,"DescriptionThis very rare porcelain cup is called a hollyhock cup because its rim resembles a hollyhock blossom. This type of cup was produced only in the state-owned kiln for a limited time from the late 1400s to mid-1500s. Like sunflowers, hollyhocks also open their blooms toward the sun, signifying loyalty to the king. According to Korean royal archives, hollyhock cups were used during state banquets when the king offered wine to court officials. Also, a hollyhock-shaped cup was used in tea ceremonies to welcome visiting Chinese diplomats. In comparison to ceramic works of the late Joseon period that favor natural and rustic sensibilities seen in this gallery, this hollyhock cup illustrates the precision and perfection that were core aesthetic values of early Joseon period art.",Type of artwork: Ceramic

Floral and vegetal motifs are a hallmark of Iznik pottery. The center of this dish is covered in a dynamic artichoke motif interwoven with rosettes and serrated saz leaves. The artichoke design was likely inspired by luxury Italian textiles imported into the Ottoman court.

Fluted Cup with Dragon Handle,,"DescriptionVery thinly potted, the subtly lobed body of this cup is almost translucent. The thin, slightly opaque, light greenish glaze lends a sugary shine. Applied elements, including the handle, beaded borders, and sculptural floret, are constructed and glazed with the same materials as the body, providing a seamless blend of form and decorative embellishment. The result is an evocative reminder of slightly earlier silver cups, also created in the form of flowers. This pristine, natural construction is challenged, however, by the archaic dragon that acts as the handle. Borrowed from the decoration found on much earlier bronzes, this added form illustrates the eclecticism of the Yuan, the attempt to blend present vision with interest in the past.",Type of artwork: Ceramic

"Flowers of Four Seasons, with Poems","China, Ming dynasty","DescriptionIn this painting, flowers are loosely arranged by the seasons: narcissus and peony represent early spring; yellow loquat and lotus, summer; chrysanthemum, autumn; and the plum and evergreen bamboo, winter. The artist added to each flower a poetic line of calligraphy associating each plant with a historic or legendary figure. For example, the chrysanthemum, along with the line “The untrammeled joy at the eastern fence,” refers to the poet Tao Yuanming (died AD 427) who enjoyed chrysanthemums at the eastern fence in his garden. The scroll illustrates Wang Guxiang’s mastery of free brushwork, combining light monochrome ink with transparent colors. In his inscription, Wang says he used the “boneless” style without outlines as developed during the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). Wang was a native of Changzhou, a city in southeast China known for its rich flora and fauna, and flower-and-bird painting tradition.",Type of artwork: Painting

Bodhidharma Crossing the Yangzi on a Reed,,"DescriptionChan Buddhism was introduced to China in the early 500s by the Indian monk Bodhidharma, or Puti Damo (died before 534). Upon his arrival in China, Bodhidharma was allegedly granted an audience with the Liang dynasty emperor Wu (reigned 502–49). Realizing the emperor did not understand his mission, the monk left Nanjing, crossed the Yangzi on a reed, and settled north in Henan province’s Shaolin monastery. Here, Bodhidharma is sketched in few pale brushstrokes. The diluted and swift lines on an empty ground emphasize the Chan idea that all things are illusionary. The inscription reads: Wind rises from the reed flowers, the waves are high; It’s a long way to go beyond the cliff of the Shaoshi mountain; Above the worlds of kalpas a flower is opening into five petals; So that your barefoot heels are just fine for the whipping rattans. —translated by Wai-Kam Ho",Type of artwork: Painting

A simple glass flask is filled with a large rose, a red anemone, and a white narcissus tinged with pink. These flowers are surrounded by a scattering of smaller blossoms. Like many still-life painters, Verelst depicted a window reflected in the glass vase, but here he did not show the window's precise structure. He did, however, use another common device: the depiction of a few chips in the stone surface to make the material seem more tangible. Early in his career, Verelst moved from Holland to London, where he worked for the court of King James II and was extravagantly praised for the realism of his flower paintings.",Type of artwork: Painting
Pitcher,,"DescriptionThe chrysanthemum is the flower of autumn. In East Asia, its wine was believed to bring longevity if drunk during the Double Nine Festival (September 9). ""Drinking Wine,"" a poem by Tao Yuanming (365–427), combines the flower with the theme of the reclusive life: ""From the eastern fence, I pluck chrysanthemum flowers, and idly look toward the southern hills."" In Korea, the chrysanthemum was established as a popular motif for Goryeo inlaid celadon as early as the 1100s. The flower was used as the main motif for wine service vessels in particular. When Koreans drank wine from Goryeo celadon decorated with chrysanthemum designs, they believed that Tao’s faithful spirit transferred to their inner mind, as did the blessings of longevity.",Type of artwork: Ceramic

Flowers and Vegetables,"America, 19th century","DescriptionThis lithograph served as an advertisement for the seeds sold at James Vick in Rochester, New York, a leading American nursery center in the latter half of the 19th century. An auxiliary business, the production of fruit and flower prints aided nurserymen and their travelling salesmen. At first the lithographs were hand colored, but in 1871 a local company began to print in color. Lithographs are made by drawing a design onto a stone with a greasy crayon; water adheres to the bare stone while the printing ink sticks to the greasy areas. The process was invented at the end of the 18th century and was often used after about 1820 because it is a speedy and inexpensive medium, producing more impressions compared to other tonal techniques such as mezzotint, aquatint, and stipple.",Type of artwork: Print

Flowering Bush above an Eroded Bank,"Italy, 16th century","DescriptionFederico Barocci, who worked in Urbino, made landscape sketches for use in his paintings and as independent studies. The artist’s multimedia approach—combining chalks, ink washes, and opaque paints—was novel at the time but would become standard practice for landscape artists working in later centuries. Novel, as well, was his interest in excerpts of the natural world rather than fully realized scenes. Here, the artist drew an eroded bank with a few bold lines in black chalk, then used a brush to layer brown and white ink washes, capturing the untamed clump of earth with remarkable naturalism.",Type of artwork: Drawing
Birds and Flowers in a Landscape of the Four Seasons,"Japan, Muromachi period","DescriptionThe monk-painter Sesshp is revered today, as he was in his own time. While he left Kyoto's sophisticated intel-lectual and cultural environment to live in a provincial village in a far western province, he seems never to have severed contacts with the monastic communities of his young adulthood. His residence in Yamaguchi proved fortuitous because his patron, the region's military lord, enjoyed considerable freedom in conducting trade missions overseas with Korea and China. Sesshp went to China in 1467 and traveled about the country, visiting well-known historical sites and Chan (Zen) temples before returning two years later. Thus he became familiar with contemporary painting practices, materials, formats, and subject matter. His assimilation and then transmission of these elements had a profound impact on the following generations of ink painters, patrons, and Zen communities throughout Japan. Despite the presence on these byøbu of the name ""Sesshp,"" they are from the hand of another accom-plished but as yet anonymous follower active in the middle of the sixteenth century. Sesshp's name here, as on a handful of similar bird-and-flower byøbu, attests to the master's identification at that time with the colorful mural paintings on the same theme emanating from Ming dynasty China. This genre had heretofore been relegated to hanging scroll compositions, so the intro-duction into temple and daimyo residences of such an attractive theme surely caused considerable excitement in the later fifteenth century, when in all likelihood Sesshp introduced it into the Japanese painting reper-toire. Subsequently, artists of varying backgrounds and training tried their hands at these large, dramatic scenes. From right to left the composition portrays an array of flowering plants in the near distance that indicate the passage of the seasons. Birds, usually paired, occupy this setting, engaged in various activities that lend naturalism and an air of peacefulness. The world they inhabit may be characterized pictorially by expansive middle-ground waterscapes that end where the far distant mountains rise as backdrops. These features appear consistently in other bird-and-flower byøbu attributed to Sesshp. Also noteworthy is the absence of any birds of prey such as the samurai's beloved hawks, emblems of fierceness and graceful strength that appear often in the byøbu of sixteenth-century Kano and Soga school painters.",Type of artwork: Painting

Upon closer inspection, ants dismember a butterfly and reptiles wait to ambush their prey.An inscription at the end of the painting gives us an idea of its meaning: Attributed to the Qing dynasty scholar Zhang Xigeng (張錫庚, 1801–1861), the inscriber relates the work to an earlier painting by Qian Xuan (錢選, c. 1235–before 1307) and further suggests that the painting may allude to the relentlessness of natural selection. By drawing a parallel to tumultuous episodes in Chinese history, the writer might even hint at the domestic rebellions and the aggression of Western powers against China in his lifetime, particularly the Opium Wars (1839–60).",Type of artwork: Painting

A Woman Putting Flowers in Her Hair,"Italy, 18th century","DescriptionScholars generally agree that Rosalba Carriera (1675-1757) developed the art of painting miniatures on ivory, in place of the traditional support of vellum, a fine animal skin. Although she became famous as a pastel painter, in her early career, Carriera decorated ivory snuff boxes-containers used to hold powdered tobacco taken by sniffing up the nostrils-for tourists. This miniature likely served as a lid to a snuff box, due to its elliptical shape in contrast to the oval or occasionally round shapes of most other miniatures. Although painters of ivory snuff boxes used watercolor, the same media artists used on vellum, the finished images on ivory were crude in comparison to those painted on vellum because ivory presents a greasy, non-absorbent surface, causing watercolor to run. Carriera revolutionized the art of watercolor painting on ivory through a process she termed her fondelli, or foundation. She developed a way in which to work in watercolor on ivory that emulated the soft powdery sophistication of her pastels. She used opaque gouache, essentially watercolor paint mixed with a gummy white, a combination of media which adhered to the oily surface of ivory. News of Carriera's innovation spread through Europe, and in the first few decades of the 1700s, most miniaturists abandoned vellum in favor of ivory.",Type of artwork: Portrait Miniature

The only adornment of his figure is the auspicious symbol on his chest and the wheels of righteousness on his palms. The stark form of thenude body standing in a posture of meditation is masterfully set off from the array of gods and serpent divinities who venerate him.

They separated when Braque enlisted in the French army at the outbreak of WWI in August 1914.

Tulips,France,"DescriptionHenri Matisse, leader of the French Fauves (“Wild Beasts”), advocated the complete liberation of color from natural appearances and reducing formal elements to absolute essentials. “What I dream of,” he wrote, “is an art of balance, purity, and serenity.” In Tulips a vase of flowers floats mysteriously against fields of thinly applied turquoise, aqua, and lavender. While the colorful tulips express a joyful sentiment, the vase rests precariously on a planar shape, perhaps a tabletop. The uncertainty of the vase’s position as it extends over the edge, and whether the tabletop continues to the right through a plane of transparent color, together with the strange black rectangle in the background, inserts a contravening feeling of disquiet and visual tension into the time-honored genre of still-life painting.",Type of artwork: Painting

Herbaceous Peony,"China, Qing dynasty","DescriptionYun Shouping came from Piling (modern Changzhou), Jiangsu province, a center of floral, plant, and insect painting. He had joined the anti-Manchu resistance, was briefly imprisoned, and witnessed the death of family members in 1644. Like other artists, Yun Shouping expressed his Ming loyalism in coded pictures. The peony, king of flowers, and a spring garden motif developed new meaning during the Qing dynasty. The inscription indicates that Yun turns the flower into a motif representing the glorious past. The herbaceous peonies here appear somewhat withered and pale, with faint reddish veins running through its broken branches, perhaps a coded message. The inscription reads, An old painting by an anonymous painter of the Northern Song Dynasty has five varieties of flowers painted in the boneless manner. Its colors are so beguiling and beautiful, that even after several hundred years its lead pigments are like new. The skill with which the ink and colors were applied and the subtlety of its composition find no equal among modern followers.",Type of artwork: Painting
Supports with Addorsed Figures,,"DescriptionThese small pillars were part of the multitiered bases of stupas—sacred Buddhist monuments. The figures that faced toward the viewer are four-armed bodhisattvas—beings on the path to perfect enlightenment. The Tibetan syllable carved at the top of the moldings denotes the position where this piece belongs in the series of other small double-sided pillars. The figures on the opposite sides, facing the stupa and unseen by visitors, are figures of four-armed goddesses who make offerings of music or gifts to the stupa. On these examples, one plays a drum; the other holds a lotus.  The figures stand on the center of a lotus flower that emerges from an overflowoing pot of abundance. Such imagery indicates that the faithful veneration of this monument will bring productive and abundant good results.",Type of artwork: Sculpture

The fowl include peacocks, parakeets, bluebirds, and possibly even Indian rollers.

Studies of Flowers after Nature:  Spray of Flowers,"France, 18th century","DescriptionCrayon manner etching was invented in the 18th century to simulate the texture of chalk drawings, which were very popular at the time.

Mirror,,"DescriptionNamed for their figured handles, Greek caryatid mirrors may derive from similar types created in ancient Egypt many centuries earlier (like CMA 1983.196). Greek caryatid handles typically take the form of a beautiful, draped woman like this one, whether mortal or divine (perhaps the love goddess Aphrodite). Often, she holds a small offering, here a flower. The small, winged women (Nikai) flanking her are unusual among such mirrors, which often feature Erotes in this position.

Gooseberries—a modest, local pleasure—could be picked in the wild, although Dutch gardeners in the 1600s were the first to cultivate them to improve their taste.

In this silk, rows of soaring phoenixes alternate with rows of makaras. Combining a fish body and tail, wings, and a dragon's head, the makara originated in India as a water creature. With the spread of Buddhism, the motif migrated into the art of Central Asia and, from there, into the art of northern China.

In Blue is a diaphanous curtain of lush, tropical colors that is both imposing for its monumental scale and delicate in its fragility. Activated by the slightest breeze, its artificial elements ripple with the movement of natural life forms. To create In Blue, Hodges took apart hundreds of silk flowers, flattened and ironed each element, pinned the pieces together, and then carefully hand-sewed them into a scrim.",Type of artwork: Textile
Lozenge Shaped Dish from Dessert Service: Large Flowered St. John's Wort,"England, Derby, 18th century","DescriptionEach dish is decorated with recognizable plants, the names of which are inscribed on the base in both Latin and English. Identifying the blossoms only became customary in the late 18th century when a single piece of porcelain was decorated with one species, and flowers were represented along with leaves, stems, seed pods, and roots. All of this reflects Carolus Linnaeus’s recent invention of a scientific method to categorize all known flora. The decorations on the Derby factory’s products derive from contemporary English botanical publications. For instance, illustrations in William Curtis’s The Botanical Magazine served as models for the French marigold and nettle-leaved bell flower on the dessert service.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
Silk Sleeve Decoration with Hunters,,"DescriptionThis silk sleeve blends technical and stylistic elements that occurred in early Islamic art. The sides of the sleeve are decorated with a lotus flower design, an ancient Egyptian motif that was absorbed into Hellenistic and Byzantine art. The upper panel displays a large medallion composed of leaves and palmettes, common vegetal motifs in Islamic art of this period. Below, the mace-wielding horseman is identified in Coptic inscriptions as Joseph, father of Jesus and saint within the Coptic faith. The image is likely derived from the Byzantine representation of the victorious emperor.",Type of artwork: Textile

This jar with susancai (plain three-color) decoration uses shades of light green, purple, and yellow, but no red. The vase features a pair of pheasants looking at each other among flowering plants, such as peonies and magnolia. The porcelain painter used fine dark outlines in a more graphic style to delineate motifs, to texture rocks, and depict minute details such as holes in weathered leaves of plants.",Type of artwork: Ceramic

Velvet panel with four youths smelling flowers,,"DescriptionA new style depicting single figures with limited modeling and European artistic influence was spearheaded by the Iranian painter Riza ‘Abbasi and adopted by textile designers in sumptuous brocaded velvets. Even with faded colors, this grand length retains ten colors of velvet pile, a feat that Iranian velvet weavers achieved by skillfully replacing colored pile warp during weaving, and thereby creating the most colorful velvets in the world. Elegant youths dominate the simplified outdoor setting here with diminutive cypresses and silver ponds on a ground originally covered with gold thread. Fashionably dressed young men wear wide-brimmed hats, silver robes, stole-like scarves, and knotted sashes that are symbols of status and rank.",Type of artwork: Velvet
A marbled picture of Rustam catching Rakhsh,"India, Bijapur, Deccan","DescriptionThis scene depicts the young hero Rustam catching a foal, Rakhsh (meaning “light”), who will be his faithful companion through many adventures. A prophet-like shepherd figure with a staff at the upper left predicts that Rustam will be the savior of Iran. At the top of the page a feline has caught its prey, while a hunter steps on its tail. This extraordinary painting has more applications of marbled colorant than any other known example. Even all the flowers and birds have been articulated through marbling in a feat of registration and control by a master of the technique.",Type of artwork: Painting
Side Table,,"DescriptionLong, rectangular tables were often placed against a wall to hold candlestands, flower vases, or incense burners. It was customary to hang ancestor portraits, images of religious figures, or seasonal paintings above the table that would convey auspicious wishes and blessings to the family.

Utopia,"Belgium, 20th century","DescriptionRené Magritte was among the leading figures of the Surrealist movement, whose work emphasized dreams, the subconscious, and a break from reason and logic during the early 20th century. Magritte, in particular, often situated realistic imagery within ridiculous or unusual situations in order to question perception. Here, a rose grows on a rocky island amid a vast sea, set against a blue sky filled with large white clouds. By situating the flower within a barren and inhospitable setting, Magritte invites the viewer to question its purpose and survival. Created as World War II came to an end, the enigmatic image could symbolize a new beginning, although Magritte avoided assigning it a specific meaning.",Type of artwork: Drawing

Brocade with Lotus Flowers,,"DescriptionThe tradition of brocade weaving in northern China continued after the Mongol conquest. However, the arrival of eastern Iranian craftsmen affected both the design and the structure of the brocades: patterns became symmetrical and paired warps replaced single warps. Both of these modifications can be observed in this example. At the same time, however, the Jin tradition of floating foundation wefts across the back sides of the brocaded areas continued. Brocades such as this may have been woven in Hongzhou (in Hebei province), where weavers from both western Asia and from the former Jin capital, Bianjing, are known to have worked together.",Type of artwork: Textile
A Pair of Decorated Palanquin Hooks and Rings,,"DescriptionHooks, suspension rings, and finials cast in bronze are very common fixtures in Cambodian decorative art. Frequently they served a practical function, such as the present set, used for a palanquin in which a person was carried from place to place. The litter or throne was fastened to the rings which in turn were suspended from the books fixed by bolts to transverse poles carried on the shoulders of the palanquin bearers. Chariots, palanquins, furniture, and harnesses were frequently embellished with various bronze decorations, finials, and fixtures. Those, as a rule, were gilded making the objects they served look very sumptuous. The relief sculpture found on various Khmer monuments, such as Angkor Wat or Bayon for instance, illustrates well the use and context of those bronze implements in ancient Cambodian life. These frequently elaborate bronze fixtures were decorated with motifs generally popular in Cambodian art: such as nagas, garudas, floral, or animal patterns. This pair of hooks and rings, unusually large in size, take on a naga form in the hooks. They are decorated with perforated floral and animal motifs done with great care and precision. The rings, suspended from hooks, are in the form of tri-fold flower stalks with naga motifs repeated at the end of the curved stalks. Such elaborate and huge hooks and rings must have, no doubt, decorated a palanquin of an important individual, possible a ruler himself. Their decoration is typical of the mature Angkor Wat style.",Type of artwork: Sculpture

"Portrait of a Woman near a Fountain, a Rose in Her Hand",Netherlands,"DescriptionThe Dutch artist Johann Thopas made meticulous drawn portraits of merchants and intellectuals in the Dutch city of Assendelft. His drawn portraits—made faster and for less expense than painted portraits—appealed to middle-class patrons, as did his unique style combining naturalistic likenesses with elaborate background settings.

Inkstand,,"DescriptionThis enamel inkstand takes the fanciful form of a pleasure boat, linking the composing of poetry and the writing of calligraphy to the amusement of the senses. The luxurious materials and elegant form also indicate that scribal activities require a certain level of refinement. Cleverly, the enamelist placed a lotus design on the bottom of the vessel; as a flower that floats on water, the bloom represents both the water imaginatively splashing against the underside of the boat and the actual ink swishing inside the bilge. This inkstand was purchased by Cleveland Museum of Art founder Jeptha Homer Wade II (1857–1926) and his wife Ellen Garretson Wade (1857–1917) as they made a tour of India on their own pleasure boat, the Wadena.",Type of artwork: Jewelry

"Stele of the High Priest of Ptah, Shedsunefertem",,"DescriptionThis stele of Shedsunefertem, the High Priest of Ptah, is rich in religious symbolism. In the center of the top register is a disk and crescent, originally gilded. At either side a baboon raises its arms in adoration. The Egyptians believed that the jabbering of the baboons at dawn was a hymn of praise to the sun god Ra in a secret language only the king understood. It begins, ""Praising Ra when he shines on the horizon."" Directly below in the middle register a child god is seated on a lotus flower. In Egyptian mythology the sun arose out of the primeval waters at the dawn of creation in a lotus flower. Winged figures of Maat, goddess of Truth, stand protectively at either side.

Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints Francis and Giovanni Gualberto,"Italy, Florence, 16th century","DescriptionThe Madonna sits upon a throne with the Christ child standing on her knee. He is steadied by his mother, turning delicately to grasp her robe for support. On the left is Saint Francis, identified by his stigmata. On the right, Saint Giovanni Gualberto is identified by his monk's robe and distinctive processional cross. The brown robes of the saints, the purple of the Virgin's tunic (a shade characteristic of the artist), and the flesh tones of the figures contrast strongly against the bright blue background. In the semicircular sky behind the figures, three winged cherub heads emerge, representing a host of angels. Glazed terracotta is both durable and decorative and the gleaming white of this piece would have stood out in the darkness of a church. The medium was made popular by Renaissance artist Luca della Robbia and came into fashion as a substitute for expensive carved marble. A rounded arch frame embellished with fruit and flower garlands as well as egg-and-dart and cord moldings accompanied the work when it was acquired, but was later determined not to be original and removed. Buglioni's work bears the influence of the della Robbias, particularly in the simple color scheme. Buglioni likely worked in the studio of Luca's nephew, Andrea, where he would have learned the technique of glazing terracotta.",Type of artwork: Sculpture

"Collection of Flowers and Fruits Painted after Nature:  Bouquet of Foxglove, Clematis, Pansy, Peony, Poppy, and Yellow Day Lily","France, late 18th-early 19th Century","DescriptionBy the mid-17th century, there was a surge of interest in beautiful, exotic plants and formal royal gardens. At Fountainebleau and the Louvre, the gardens were filled with flowers from far-away places, such as the Near East, India, the East and West Indies, and South America. In 1735 Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) invented the first scientific classification system for 7,700 plants. As a result, accuracy as well as artistic skill were required for the numerous portfolios of botanical prints popular with gardeners and those involved with the decorative arts. In these lavish productions, some of the color is printed but the remainder is added with watercolor, giving the illusion of transparency, luminosity, and the delicacy characteristic of flowers. Stipple was a technique developed in England from the 1760s. A point is used to build up a mass of flicks and dots to create a wide range of tones.",Type of artwork: Print

Covered Jar with Carved Lotus Petals,,"DescriptionThis jar still has its original cover, which is rare among surviving examples. Its missing knob most likely had the shape of a lotus bud. Beautifully carved lotus petals cover the vessel’s shoulder and lid under a translucent green glaze. In Buddhism, the lotus is a flower symbolizing purity and detachment from worldly affairs; its presence suggests that this vessel was meant to be used in a religious context. The well-crafted double loop handles may have held a silk cloth or other textile that would have been folded over the lid to keep it in place. This aesthetic prefigures the celebrated green celadons in adjacent regions.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
"Portrait of Sardar Singh (Son of Savant Singh, 1730–68)",,"DescriptionThe ruler of the princely state of Kishangarh chose to have himself depicted in an intoxicatingly paradisiacal setting. He and his queen occupy jeweled chairs on a white marble terrace with formal flower gardens overlooking a lake. They listen to a musical performance while female attendants stand ready to whisk away flies and serve tiny bottles liquor. The fresh palette and dramatically elongated eyes, especially on the women, are hallmarks of the most celebrated works from this Rajput court. The king is portrayed with less exaggerated features than the women, which makes him seem more human, despite the halo that sets off his face and elaborate turban.",Type of artwork: Painting

Hookah Base,,"DescriptionSmoking tobacco was introduced to the Mughal court from Iran in the very early 1600s and soon became popular. This base formed part of a hookah, or water pipe, which consisted of a base that held water—sometimes perfumed with herbs or fresh fruit—a detachable bowl to hold tobacco, and a long tube. Early hookahs used existing vessels for bases, including coconut shells. By the late 1600s or early 1700s, richly decorated pieces like this were produced. The jewel-like decoration of blue and green blossoms evokes a garden in which a smoker might have sat.",Type of artwork: Glass
Nō Costume (Nuihaku) with  Blossoming Trees and Flowers,,"DescriptionThis magnificent robe was a costume specifically designed for performances of Noh theater in Japan. Originating during the 1300s from simple folk plays, Noh drama evolved into formal presentations of ritual, theater, dance, and music performed in the courts and shrines of the nobility. Stories were derived from a variety of sources—myths, legends, poetry, and prose—many dating back to the medieval period. Because great importance was placed on subtlety and elegance, plots tended to be minimal. Whether male or female all roles were played by men. Central to these performances were the masks and costumes worn by the actors. The brilliance and elegance of this robe are characteristic of costumes made solely for Noh theater. Its date in the first half of the 1700s is indicated by the proportions of the robe, the choice of embroidery stitches (satin, couching, and outline), and the absence of decoration at the hips, a fashion also reflected in kimonos at that time. The design of weeping cherry trees and irises in the snow was very likely inspired by a medieval Japanese poem. Robes decorated with embroidery against a gold ground were reserved for female roles. These robes were worn under the external garment and were only partially visible.",Type of artwork: Garment
Padmapani Lokeshvara Seated on the Rock,,"DescriptionThough diminutive, this image conveys a monumental power through the intense expression particular to Kashmiri art.

Scenes from the Life of Buddha,,"DescriptionIn this compact narrative relief, which was made to adorn a Buddhist stupa, scenes from the early life of the Buddha are depicted in order from top to bottom. His birth is at the top. The infant, now broken, is being received by Indra, King of the Gods, from the right side of his mother, who is depicted like a tree deity, grasping a branch with one hand. The baby Buddha miraculously took seven steps immediately after he was born, as indicated by the standing diminutive figure at the left of the scene. The next scene depicts the bodhisattva Maitreya, who will be the next Buddha to be born in the future, as an element of foreshadowing. Returning to the life of the historical Buddha, the sculptors then depict him as a prince, enjoying palace life with his wife. Eventually, he is compelled to leave his family to seek enlightenment and try to end the suffering in the world. In the lowest panel he rides off to the forest with a carved halo behind his head. In the border areas are meditating Buddha images, worshippers, guardians, and earth deities who drag a massive flower garland adorning the panel.",Type of artwork: Sculpture

Bouquet,"France, 17th century","DescriptionSeventeenth-century botanical illustrators were stimulated by a surge of interest in their subject. While in the mid-16th century only 500 plants were known, less than a century later that number had grown to 6,000. A passion for cultivating beautiful rather than useful plants took hold, and formal gardens with carefully arranged flower beds based on embroidery designs supplemented varieties of local plants with foreign samples. Exotic flowers became available in Europe as the Dutch founded colonies in the East and West Indies, South America, and India. While fabulous royal gardens were planted in France at Fontainebleau and the Louvre, for instance, in England “a whole nation went mad about flowers.”",Type of artwork: Print

Yellow Chrysanthemums and Red Osmanthus in the Style of Wang Yuan,"China, Ming dynasty","DescriptionShen Zhou, a native from Suzhou, was descended from a prominent land-owning family with strong ties to literati culture. Because Shen Zhou never entered government service, he had ample opportunity to cultivate the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy.Chrysanthemums and red osmanthus both bloom in autumn. The deep orange osmanthus flowers emanate a characteristically sweet fragrance. According to his inscription on the painting, Shen Zhou sought to imitate the style of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) painter Wang Yuan. His color-filled brushstrokes and washes, however, anticipate the flower painting style of Yun Shouping, whose Peonies are also in the Cleveland Museum of Art collection, https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1967.192.

Hevajra,,"DescriptionHevajra was an important figure signaling the practice of Buddhist rituals. King Jayavarman VII placed particular emphasis on Hevajra during consecration rituals and set up a colossal stone sculpture of dancing Hevajra at the east gate of his fortified city in the Khmer capital at Angkor. In the Cambodia of Jayavarman VII, tantric Buddhism became public and widespread, practiced together with other more mainstream forms of Buddhism, Hinduism, and ancestor worship. The iconography of Hevajra is described in detail in a text that bears his name, the Hevajra-tantra, first composed in India probably in the 800s. Hevajra has eight heads, sixteen arms, and four legs. His left hands hold images of Indic gods; wealth, death, sun, moon, fire, wind, water, and earth. In his right hands are animals: bull, lion, human, cat, camel, sheep, horse, and elephant. They all sit in skull cups, objects also used in tantric rituals. He dances on a corpse that embodies ignorance and is surrounded by eight yoginis who dance triumphantly in a ring around him. Yoginis functioned as intercessors between human practitioners and enlightened beings. Many bronze images of Hevajra were made during the reign of Jayavarman VII, but few survive in as pristine condition as this example. According to scientific analysis and curatorial reports, this sculpture survived in a clay vessel submerged in water, which accounts for its high tin content and unusual gray patina. Samples from the clay core reveal the presence of the mineral feldspar, a characteristic of clay from the Isaan plateau, on the other side of the mountain range not far from Banteay Chhmar, in present-day Thailand.",Type of artwork: Sculpture
"Vase with Inlaid Lotus, Plum, and Bamboo Design",,"DescriptionFlattened-shaped jars like this one started to appear around the late 13th century. Each of the flattened sides is decorated with an image of a lotus flower pond, enclosed in a lobed panel. The protruding sides, on the other hand, depict an image of bamboo trees and plum blossoms. This particular example seems to have been produced in the late 14th century, when the overall quality of techniques involved in making celadon works sharply deteriorated. In contrast to translucent greenish blue celadon works of the 12th century, this flask has gray greenish glaze due to less refined clay. Furthermore, its rather roughly executed inlaid design shows a clear sign of decline in craftsmanship. Nevertheless, less attention to technical details gave way to a freer style pottery called buncheong in the succeeding centuries.",Type of artwork: Ceramic

Portrait of a Woman with Flowers,"America, 20th century","DescriptionFor more than 50 years, James VanDerZee produced images that embody the spirit of Harlem. From the 1920s to the 1940s, he was the neighborhood's most popular and prolific photographer, his camera capturing everyone from ordinary citizens to celebrities. In the studio VanDerZee photographed glamorously dressed young people and dignified men and women. On location, he chronicled picnics, parades, families, church congregations, and the dead in their coffins. These four prints, from a collection of 33 recently acquired by the museum, show VanDerZee's skill at posing and lighting his subjects. His artistic sensibilities are reflected in elaborate backdrops and the use of accessories that reinforced his sitters' associations with culture and wealth. The artist worked with a variety of techniques, including multiple negatives and hand coloring, to make artful photographs that set him apart from his more traditional, less aesthetically inclined competitors. Just as he often signed his name and date directly onto the negative, he would also selectively draw on it-to smooth a complexion and touch up imperfections, or to add extra jewelry or smoke drifting from a cigarette-whatever was necessary to emphasize the grace and dignity of his client, regardless of race, age, or social status.",Type of artwork: Photograph

Icon of the Virgin and Child,,"DescriptionThis tapestry glorifying the Virgin Mary is among the rarest objects in the museum’s collection. In a composition borrowed from imperial Byzantine art, Mary is shown seated on a jeweled throne with the Christ child and flanked by archangels Michael and Gabriel. Above, Christ appears in a radiant light supported by two angels. Portraits of the apostles, identified in Greek, appear in the surrounding wreath symbolizing eternal life. This portable sacred textile was presumably displayed at the front of a public or private place of worship. This unique tapestry is one of the earliest Christian icons to survive. Woven icons were among the miraculous works shown to pilgrims in Jerusalem according to Abbot Adomnan of Iona (about 624–704) who described a linen cloth ""said to have been woven by Saint Mary, and is for this reason preserved in a church and venerated by the whole population. Pictures of the twelve apostles are woven into it, and there is also a portrait of the Lord."" The abbot’s description of the woven icon suggests it must have been similar to the tapestry displayed here. The delicate effects of shading in the facial features, garments, and vegetation were achieved by weaving the panel sideways with at least 20 colors, just as medieval tapestry weavers did centuries later in Europe. The high cost of dyes caused this majestic icon to be far costlier than painted images.",Type of artwork: Textile

The Buddha sits on a double lotus pedestal that indicates the presence of a transcendent being. The sculptural style is typical of sculptures made at the Buddhist site of Pagan. Sculptures such as this were installed in niches in an interior passage of a temple. As is typical of Burmese works, this sculpture was carved from a solid piece of wood. Its surface was covered in black lacquer and then gilded; a great deal of the gilding remains intact. Because lacquer is an easily perishable material, works of this type and size are exceedingly rare; this sculpture is one of the best extant examples.",Type of artwork: Lacquer

At the top of the composition, a dancer dressed in blue with a peacock-feather crown plays the part of Krishna. In the upper right corner, a canopy painted with swirling storm clouds stands for the rainstorm sent by the jealous king of the gods, who is shown in the middle of the canopy with his consort and mount, the elephant with seven trunks. Guards and grooms in the foreground entertain themselves with music while they wait with the horses of visiting nobles. The formal geometric gardens, playful use of perspective, and individualized portraiture indicate the selective adoption of the styles and sensibilities of the imperial Mughal court in the paintings from this large-format series.",Type of artwork: Painting
Black and White Lilies III,"America, 20th century","DescriptionIn the early 1920s, Cunningham combined the clarity and directness of modernism with her long-held interest in botanical imagery. For two decades she created a remarkable group of close-up studies of plants and flowers that identified her as one of the most sophisticated and experimental photographers working in America. In this dramatic, tightly cropped composition, Cunningham isolated two lilies against a simple velvet backdrop. A black calla (arum palaestium) was rhythmically placed in front of a white calla (zantedeschia aethiopica). The expanded scale of the black flower, with its partially visible spadix diagonally positioned, dominates the picture. The sculptural shapes and rich textures were emphasized by the combination of daylight and blue tungsten photofloods and the copious detail provided by the 8x10-inch negative.

Scenes from the Life of Buddha,,"DescriptionIn this compact narrative relief, which was made to adorn a Buddhist stupa, scenes from the early life of the Buddha are depicted in order from top to bottom. His birth is at the top. The infant, now broken, is being received by Indra, King of the Gods, from the right side of his mother, who is depicted like a tree deity, grasping a branch with one hand. The baby Buddha miraculously took seven steps immediately after he was born, as indicated by the standing diminutive figure at the left of the scene. The next scene depicts the bodhisattva Maitreya, who will be the next Buddha to be born in the future, as an element of foreshadowing. Returning to the life of the historical Buddha, the sculptors then depict him as a prince, enjoying palace life with his wife. Eventually, he is compelled to leave his family to seek enlightenment and try to end the suffering in the world. In the lowest panel he rides off to the forest with a carved halo behind his head. In the border areas are meditating Buddha images, worshippers, guardians, and earth deities who drag a massive flower garland adorning the panel.",Type of artwork: Sculpture

A passion for cultivating beautiful rather than useful plants took hold, and formal gardens with carefully arranged flower beds based on embroidery designs supplemented varieties of local plants with foreign samples. Exotic flowers became available in Europe as the Dutch founded colonies in the East and West Indies, South America, and India.

Yellow Chrysanthemums and Red Osmanthus in the Style of Wang Yuan,"China, Ming dynasty","DescriptionShen Zhou, a native from Suzhou, was descended from a prominent land-owning family with strong ties to literati culture.

The deep orange osmanthus flowers emanate a characteristically sweet fragrance. According to his inscription on the painting, Shen Zhou sought to imitate the style of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) painter Wang Yuan.

Hevajra,,"DescriptionHevajra was an important figure signaling the practice of Buddhist rituals. King Jayavarman VII placed particular emphasis on Hevajra during consecration rituals and set up a colossal stone sculpture of dancing Hevajra at the east gate of his fortified city in the Khmer capital at Angkor. In the Cambodia of Jayavarman VII, tantric Buddhism became public and widespread, practiced together with other more mainstream forms of Buddhism, Hinduism, and ancestor worship. The iconography of Hevajra is described in detail in a text that bears his name, the Hevajra-tantra, first composed in India probably in the 800s. Hevajra has eight heads, sixteen arms, and four legs. His left hands hold images of Indic gods; wealth, death, sun, moon, fire, wind, water, and earth. In his right hands are animals: bull, lion, human, cat, camel, sheep, horse, and elephant. They all sit in skull cups, objects also used in tantric rituals. He dances on a corpse that embodies ignorance and is surrounded by eight yoginis who dance triumphantly in a ring around him. Yoginis functioned as intercessors between human practitioners and enlightened beings. Many bronze images of Hevajra were made during the reign of Jayavarman VII, but few survive in as pristine condition as this example. According to scientific analysis and curatorial reports, this sculpture survived in a clay vessel submerged in water, which accounts for its high tin content and unusual gray patina. Samples from the clay core reveal the presence of the mineral feldspar, a characteristic of clay from the Isaan plateau, on the other side of the mountain range not far from Banteay Chhmar, in present-day Thailand.",Type of artwork: Sculpture

Each of the flattened sides is decorated with an image of a lotus flower pond, enclosed in a lobed panel. The protruding sides, on the other hand, depict an image of bamboo trees and plum blossoms. This particular example seems to have been produced in the late 14th century, when the overall quality of techniques involved in making celadon works sharply deteriorated. In contrast to translucent greenish blue celadon works of the 12th century, this flask has gray greenish glaze due to less refined clay. Furthermore, its rather roughly executed inlaid design shows a clear sign of decline in craftsmanship.

Hatsuito ties her servant’s obi sash while a gibbon emerges from a painting in the room’s viewing alcove to offer a love letter on which Hatsuito’s name appears.

Portrait of a Woman with Flowers,"America, 20th century","DescriptionFor more than 50 years, James VanDerZee produced images that embody the spirit of Harlem. From the 1920s to the 1940s, he was the neighborhood's most popular and prolific photographer, his camera capturing everyone from ordinary citizens to celebrities. In the studio VanDerZee photographed glamorously dressed young people and dignified men and women. On location, he chronicled picnics, parades, families, church congregations, and the dead in their coffins. These four prints, from a collection of 33 recently acquired by the museum, show VanDerZee's skill at posing and lighting his subjects. His artistic sensibilities are reflected in elaborate backdrops and the use of accessories that reinforced his sitters' associations with culture and wealth. The artist worked with a variety of techniques, including multiple negatives and hand coloring, to make artful photographs that set him apart from his more traditional, less aesthetically inclined competitors. Just as he often signed his name and date directly onto the negative, he would also selectively draw on it-to smooth a complexion and touch up imperfections, or to add extra jewelry or smoke drifting from a cigarette-whatever was necessary to emphasize the grace and dignity of his client, regardless of race, age, or social status.",Type of artwork: Photograph

Icon of the Virgin and Child,,"DescriptionThis tapestry glorifying the Virgin Mary is among the rarest objects in the museum’s collection. In a composition borrowed from imperial Byzantine art, Mary is shown seated on a jeweled throne with the Christ child and flanked by archangels Michael and Gabriel. Above, Christ appears in a radiant light supported by two angels. Portraits of the apostles, identified in Greek, appear in the surrounding wreath symbolizing eternal life. This portable sacred textile was presumably displayed at the front of a public or private place of worship. This unique tapestry is one of the earliest Christian icons to survive. Woven icons were among the miraculous works shown to pilgrims in Jerusalem according to Abbot Adomnan of Iona (about 624–704) who described a linen cloth ""said to have been woven by Saint Mary, and is for this reason preserved in a church and venerated by the whole population. Pictures of the twelve apostles are woven into it, and there is also a portrait of the Lord."" The abbot’s description of the woven icon suggests it must have been similar to the tapestry displayed here. The delicate effects of shading in the facial features, garments, and vegetation were achieved by weaving the panel sideways with at least 20 colors, just as medieval tapestry weavers did centuries later in Europe. The high cost of dyes caused this majestic icon to be far costlier than painted images.",Type of artwork: Textile

The Buddha sits on a double lotus pedestal that indicates the presence of a transcendent being. The sculptural style is typical of sculptures made at the Buddhist site of Pagan. Sculptures such as this were installed in niches in an interior passage of a temple. As is typical of Burmese works, this sculpture was carved from a solid piece of wood.

Maharana Jagat Singh Attending the Raslila,"Northwestern India, Rajasthan, Mewar, Udaipur, 18th century","DescriptionTo celebrate the New Year festival of Diwali, dancers reenact the life story of the Hindu god Krishna in a palace courtyard by candlelight under the full moon. The king, a vassal of the Mughal emperor, sits with the halo of divine sanction for his rule at the left of the courtyard, smoking from a golden goat-shaped hookah, with his young son and heir at his side. At the top of the composition, a dancer dressed in blue with a peacock-feather crown plays the part of Krishna. In the upper right corner, a canopy painted with swirling storm clouds stands for the rainstorm sent by the jealous king of the gods, who is shown in the middle of the canopy with his consort and mount, the elephant with seven trunks. Guards and grooms in the foreground entertain themselves with music while they wait with the horses of visiting nobles. The formal geometric gardens, playful use of perspective, and individualized portraiture indicate the selective adoption of the styles and sensibilities of the imperial Mughal court in the paintings from this large-format series.",Type of artwork: Painting

Black and White Lilies III,"America, 20th century","DescriptionIn the early 1920s, Cunningham combined the clarity and directness of modernism with her long-held interest in botanical imagery. For two decades she created a remarkable group of close-up studies of plants and flowers that identified her as one of the most sophisticated and experimental photographers working in America. In this dramatic, tightly cropped composition, Cunningham isolated two lilies against a simple velvet backdrop. A black calla (arum palaestium) was rhythmically placed in front of a white calla (zantedeschia aethiopica). The expanded scale of the black flower, with its partially visible spadix diagonally positioned, dominates the picture. The sculptural shapes and rich textures were emphasized by the combination of daylight and blue tungsten photofloods and the copious detail provided by the 8x10-inch negative. This sensuous print also encompasses a luxurious range of tones, from velvety black to milky white.",Type of artwork: Photograph

One outcome of this phenomenon in the visual arts was the detailed portrayal of plant, animal, and marine life. This painting is an assemblage of objects carefully observed from nature, but not usually seen together.",Type of artwork: Painting

His muslin tunic is belted with a sash that has flowering plants embroidered on the border, which was popularized at the court of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan.

Deep Mountain Stream,"Japan, Heisei period","DescriptionThis abstracted ink landscape, with its dramatic mountain stream, is captured with a bird’s-eye view. It was produced late in the career of the artist, whose oeuvre includes landscapes, bird-and-flower and figure paintings in ink and sometimes bright colors. An industrial designer by profession, Araki’s landscapes reveal his personal devotion to traditional Chinese brush methods, learned first as a youth in China, and later through emulation of famed painter Zhang Daqian (1899–1983) in Taiwan.",Type of artwork: Painting
Female torso,,"DescriptionThis life-size sculpture of a female figure was likely installed by a doorway or in an exterior niche of a Buddhist temple. Throughout the history of Indian art, voluptuous female figures have adorned Buddhist sanctuaries. Embodying the Indian ideal of female beauty, the form of the young mother with full breasts of milk personifies abundance, nourishment, and productivity—ideas that were considered auspicious and life affirming. Her copious jewels and valuable textiles also visually relate that the good karmic actions of venerating the Buddha and following his teachings will result in abundant good fortune.",Type of artwork: Sculpture

Although the firm is known to have made a considerable quantity of gilded furniture, this fire screen is one of only a few examples to survive in good condition. The painted and gilded embossed panel of birds and flowers was likely made in Japan.",Type of artwork: Furniture and woodwork
Pair of Potpourri Vases with Covers,,"DescriptionThese vases were likely made by the celebrated Parisian ceramics firm of Edmé Samson (1810-91). To cater to the resurgence in taste for 18th-century designs, the Samson firm specialized in making reproductions of rare 18th-century European porcelains, especially those from firms that had already copied Chinese porcelains. In this case, these vases are designs taken from models produced by the St. Cloud factory in the 1750s after earlier Qing dynasty Chinese ceramics. However, the telltale sign that these vases are made by Samson and not St. Cloud is that the originals would have been made from a soft-paste porcelain (fired at a lower temperature), while these examples are made of hard-paste porcelain (fired at the highest temperature).",Type of artwork: Ceramic
Portrait of the Marquise d'Aguirandes,"France, 18th century","DescriptionLike many French portraitists active during the ancien régime, François-Hubert Drouais was skilled at veiling the physical imperfections of his subjects. This portrait certainly has this quality: the face has been idealized, smoothed, and perfected, but the focus of the painting is less on the Marquise and more on her elegant gown, which is a particularly fine rendering of eighteenth-century printed cloth, with the brilliant gold and white fabric strewn with meticulously detailed flowers and lace.",Type of artwork: Painting

Hand Mirror,France,"DescriptionWe often think of art as the work of just one person. In the case of this mirror, its harmonious appearance conceals the number of people involved in its creation. The designer Félix Bracquemond was commissioned by wealthy banker Baron Joseph Vitta to create decorative objects for his multiple homes. Bracquemond worked with other artists in making this mirror: well-known sculptor Auguste Rodin created the figure of Venus; artisan Alexandre Riquet fashioned the elaborate enameled decoration; and goldsmiths from Parisian jewelers Falize Frères completed the mirror and its blue translucent frame embedded with yellow, pink, and white flowers. Through close collaboration between patron, designer, and artists, this mirror represents the trend at the end of the 1800s for blending artistic specialties to create a single work of art. The CMA’s collection includes Bracquemond’s preparatory drawings for the mirror and Rodin’s carved plaster model for the figure of Venus.",Type of artwork: Miscellaneous

This triptych depicts a joyful hanami (flower viewing) scene in spring. One woman stands on a huge wine bottle, while another one sits on a samurai’s shoulder; in both scenes, the women are tying prayers or poems on tree branches. On the left, two servants protect a well-dressed lady from the wind. Their fluttering, long-sleeved kimonos capture the wind’s movement. Standing in a triad, the three groups form a stable, harmonic composition against the cherry blossom background.",Type of artwork: Print

Embroidery with Birds,,"DescriptionThese engaging little birds are embroidered in a naturalistic style that developed during the 8th and 9th centuries. All but one are oriented away from the central pair that flanks a tulip growing from a hill. Contrasting with the spontaneity of the birds is the structured pattern of the silk ground—rosettes within a lozenge grid. Such contrasts frequently occur among embroideries of the Tang dynasty. Also characteristic of embroideries from that period is the use of discrete areas of color with no attempts at shading. The form of the birds, the hill, and the flower are based on Persian models. The introduction of foreign motifs into the decorative arts of Central Asia and China was one of the most important results of active trading in precious objects along the Silk Road.",Type of artwork: Embroidery
"Puppies, Sparrows, and Chrysanthemums","Japan, Edo period","DescriptionThese paintings were originally mounted as sliding doors (fusuma) used inside a building. The circular areas on the paintings’ paper surfaces are traces of the former positions of the door pulls (hikite). A flock of sparrows gathers on a trellis supporting flowering chrysanthemum. Below is a litter of puppies, some cavorting, others napping. The tender story created by the curious puppy peering up and tilting its head to listen to the bird’s insistent call in the leftmost part of the composition is characteristic of Nagasawa Rosetsu’s paintings, which often use animals to illustrate the human condition.",Type of artwork: Painting
Wedding Gown,,"DescriptionThis wedding gown is exquisitely embroidered with various symbols of happiness in colorful silk threads. Butterflies stand for marital happiness; the phoenix, numerous offspring; and lotus flowers and white cranes, longevity. Yet, the bridal gown does not attest to the life of luxury. To the contrary, many traces of repairs, trimmings, and patchwork, reflect Joseon-period women’s commitment to value neo-Confucian aesthetics of frugality and modesty. Substantial repairs and patching reveal that this gown served as an important communal resource to be shared and passed down through several generations. Only its collar and sleeves, which are made of thick paper, are replaced with new ones, while the robe was reused for decades.",Type of artwork: Garment
Ros och Lilja (Rose and Lily),"Sweden, Vastanvik, Leksand, 20th century",DescriptionThis design was likely conceived when Ingrid “Gocken” Jobs was a student of graphic design at the Konstakademin (Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts).

Amitabha,,"DescriptionThis delicately crafted statue of Amitabha, the Buddha of Infinite Light, bears testimony to the flowering of Buddhist art under the Liao Empire established by the Khitans, a nomadic Mongolian people, after the Tang persecution of Buddhists in 845. The Liao rulers were devout Buddhists who commissioned substantial religious projects. Liao Buddhist artifacts reflecting close ties to the Tang traditions were likely executed by displaced or enslaved artisans as a result of the Khitan conquest of northern China.",Type of artwork: Sculpture
Month of May: Scene of May Day Festival,"France, 18th century, Period of Louis XV","DescriptionSeated spectators and splendidly clothed ladies and gentlemen on horseback watch May Day festivities in this tapestry. In the middle distance, archers prepare to shoot at a bush and bird placed atop a maypole, while more spectators congregate in the receding landscape. A border of rolled acanthus leaves and flower garlands frames the scene. This scene is one of twelve so-called Months of Lucas tapestries, each depicting activities that coincide with a month of the year. The original “Months of Lucas” was a sixteenth-century Flemish tapestry set that was owned by the French monarchy and mistakenly attributed to Lucas van Leyden during the 1600s. To this day, they continue to be known as the “Months of Lucas.” This original set was burned in 1797 so their gold and silver metal threads could be used to replenish the depleted French coffers. Beginning in the 1600s, the popular Months of Lucas were reproduced in several different versions under various masters at the Gobelins Manufactory in Paris, the famous royal production center for French tapestries since Louis XIV (1638–1715). The lower right hand corner of this tapestry bears the signature of Michel Audran (1701–1771), director of the Gobelins high-warp loom workshop from 1732–71, who produced this tapestry for a private patron in addition to the other royal commissions of the set.",Type of artwork: Tapestry

Gateway Bracket,,"DescriptionGateways leading into a sacred area often had large horizontal architraves, the weight of which was supported by brackets carved with figures of voluptuous women grasping the branch of a tree. They embody the ideal form of the young mother, with breasts full of nourishing milk. As personifications of the sap that pervades living plants, they are auspicious markers of life and abundance. These attractive figures, who embody the purifying water essential for life, symbolically cleanse visitors as they enter the sacred space. On both sides of this large bracket they grasp the branch of an ashoka tree, which has clusters of flowers that are bright red in nature.",Type of artwork: Sculpture
Illuminated Folio from a Gulistan (Rose Garden) of Sa'di (c. 1213–1291),Iran,"DescriptionThe border scene is set in a magical forest bursting with blossoms. At the top, a winged lion chases a winged deer, who is caught in the bottom border. The imagery of a lion biting down on its prey dates from the Achaemenid period in Iran (550–330 BCE) and references the valor of the king. A fox scurries off to the right. The verse is written in the Persian language using nastaliq script. Sultan ‘Ali Mashadi was widely renowned for perfecting the nastaliq script, and his calligraphy was a model for many followers across the Islamic world.",Type of artwork: Manuscript
Locket,,"DescriptionThis locket may have once been an amulet containing prayers and talismans or a container for perfume or other cosmetic items. At the center, a young woman stands between two groupings of large red flowers. The connections between women and nature have ancient precedents in India, often communicating auspicious fertility. Luxury enamels like this were the hallmark of 18th-century Jaipur goldsmiths and jewelry makers. This locket was given to the museum by the Twentieth Century Club, a women’s community group founded in the early 1900s with satellites across the United States.",Type of artwork: Jewelry
Costumed Dancers Performing in a Garden Tavern,"France, 18th century","DescriptionGabriel de Saint-Aubin was known for his rapidly executed, sketchy style, often used to depict performances and social scenes. The exaggerated lifted legs of the dancers seen here imply a comic, theatrical style; no social dance during the 18th century would have permitted such pronounced gestures, especially for a woman. Both dancers wear jackets with irregular hemlines decorated with round bells similar to those found on jesters’ costumes. The lanterns and swags of flowers strung from trees and the small orchestra playing on the right suggest a guinguette, or outdoor tavern with a pleasure garden.",Type of artwork: Drawing
Susuki Grass,,"DescriptionSusuki grass has a seasonal association with autumn in the Japanese visual and literary tradition. It is one of the “Seven Flowers of Autumn,” along with bush clover, arrowroot, pink, patrinia, mistflower, and bellflower.

The design may have served as a backdrop for poems brushed in calligraphy on decorated papers and attached to the surface of the screens.",Type of artwork: Painting
Bacchanalian Relief,,"DescriptionGrape vines create vignettes with scenes of drunken revelry on this architectural carving that once fit by joinery to other carved stone blocks at the base of a Buddhist monument. Bacchus himself, the Greco-Roman god of wine, may be the third figure from the left; bearded, portly, and inebriated, his garment slips as he collapses. Cupid and Aphrodite appear in the vignette on the right next to an amorous couple. On the side is a female nature divinity, grasping the branch of a tree, but unlike her counterparts from farther south in India, she is clothed in a long tunic, pants, and scarf associated with the dress of the Central Asian nomadic groups.",Type of artwork: Stone
Julius Caesar,"Italy, Florence, 15th century","DescriptionRenowned Roman general and statesman Julius Caesar (100–44 BCE) appears here as a political rather than military leader, worn by the burdens of office, with carefully described signs of aging. Mino probably used ancient coins from the collection of the Medici, Florence's ruling family, as his starting point for this sculpture. However, the complex carving, the clinging drapery, and the psychological intensity all characterize the inventiveness Renaissance artists brought to classical subject matter. In this case, Caesar offered an important model for leadership, masculinity, and composure. The garland is clearly by a different hand, but passages, such as the ribbons and flowers in low relief, correspond to details found in other decorative carvings from Mino's workshop. Initially, the limestone setting was probably put into a wall, perhaps in a lunette over the door, from which it was later removed. However, the relationship between the garland and the relief has not yet been clarified and is the subject of ongoing research.",Type of artwork: Sculpture
"The Brahman gives an account of his falling in love with the king of Babylon’s daughter to his friend, the magician, from a Tuti-nama (Tales of a Parrot): Thirty-fifth Night",,"DescriptionThe figure in orange is a magician addressing a seated Brahman—a member of India’s Hindu priestly class—who has come to him for help. He and the princess of Babylon have fallen in love and want to be together, but she is sequestered in the palace harem. The magician transformed the Brahman into a woman, shown at left, walking toward the palace. This is an example of continuous narration, in which two scenes are depicted in the same picture plane. The garden with flowering trees in the background evokes the setting where the Brahman and the princess met and fell in love.",Type of artwork: Painting

In this Persian retelling of the Old Testament account from the Bible, Zulaykha lusted after Joseph, even though she was already married to Potiphar.

The Sunflower Arch,"America, 20th century","DescriptionAt the time he made this drawing, Burchfield had begun to develop a personal symbolic language, which he called “Conventions for Abstract Thoughts.” Using simple forms, such as the arched shape of the flowers seen here, he aimed to communicate universal emotions—in this case, “Mute Sorrow.” Burchfield saw a connection between this mood and sunflowers, which were among his favorite subjects. He often depicted them anthropomorphically, suggesting either open eyes or, as here, slumped human forms—as he described, “giv[ing] a sense of pre-autumnal melancholy in early September.”",Type of artwork: Drawing
Plum Blossoms and Peonies,"China, Qing dynasty","DescriptionOne of the so-called Yangzhou Eccentrics (a group of painters who lived in Yangzhou and were known for their unorthodox art and lifestyle), Gao Fenghan depicts China’s two most loved flowers in full bloom—the “cold beauty,” or plum blossom, in the first section, and the “king of flowers,” or peony, in the second section. Painted in 1741, the year when Gao decided to leave the south and return home to Shandong province in eastern China, this work was likely a token of farewell. His casual brushwork may indicate his mental and physical struggle at the time. After having crippled his right hand in 1737, Gao used his left hand to paint and achieved a crudeness and eccentric style unattainable before.",Type of artwork: Painting

"Portrait of Anne Law (née Towry), 1st Lady Ellenborough","England, 19th century","DescriptionJohn Linnell was born and lived much of his young adulthood in Bloomsbury, where his father, James, made picture frames and restored paintings. As a boy the artist trained briefly with Benjamin West (1738–1820) and John Varley (1778–1842) before becoming a student at the Royal Academy from 1805 to 1812. Though primarily known for his landscapes, Linnell was also a prolific portraitist and executed miniatures during the first two decades of his career, learning the medium from his neighbor James Holmes (1770–1860). According to an early biographer, Linnell began painting miniatures around 1818 with a portrait of his wife. By 1823 he had executed a number of miniature commissions from aristocratic patrons, including Princess Sophia, facilitated by the praise of the society maven Lady Stafford. He painted his last known miniature on ivory in 1832. During the approximately fifteen years that the artist painted miniatures, he consistently charged between 10 and 50 guineas for a portrait. These fees corresponded less to the size of the ivory than to the degree of finish and elaboration of the composition.In this portrait Anne Law (née Towry), 1st Lady Ellenborough (c. 1769–1843), is depicted half length. She wears a high-waisted white dress of translucent fabric through which a hint of blue appears and around which she wears a black belt. A devant de corsage (stomacher, or bodice brooch) is worn at her décolletage, extending to the belt. Its gold framework contains at least twelve semiprecious stones colored blue, red, aquamarine, pink, and brown. A gold brooch with a large blue stone is pinned to the cloak at her right shoulder. She also wears a twisted multistrand pearl necklace, matching pearl pendant earrings, and two gold rings on her left ring finger. A dark gray-green shawl with red reverse, gold border, and red fringe is draped over her shoulders and arms. She holds a closed fan in her left hand and stands against a brown background featuring a green and auburn striped curtain in the upper left corner. The sitter’s fair hair is dressed in ringlets that fall at her neck. The miniature is housed in a standing gilt metal and red velvet frame that dates from the same period.",Type of artwork: Portrait Miniature

Fish in his paintings are often looking upward toward heaven, swimming in a pond of undefined space. As a member of the Ming imperial family, Zhu Da lost his princely status and hid in a monastery when the Manchus, foreigners from the north, established the Qing dynasty in 1644.

Avalokitesvara Padmapani:  Bodhisattva of Mercy Bearing a Lotus,,"DescriptionVenerated by Buddhists across the world as the perfect embodiment of compassion for all beings, this bodhisattva-a being only one stage away from complete enlightenment-holds his right hand out gently in the gesture of gift-giving. In his left hand, he once grasped the stem of a lotus flower that blossoms over his left shoulder, indicative of the abundant benefits that result from acts of loving kindness. All bodhisattvas wear royal garments and jewels, in reference to the historical Buddha’s early life as a prince, prior to his achievement of enlightenment through meditations in the forest. In the center of his crown is the tiny seated image of the meditating Buddha Amitabha that identifies this figure as Avalokitesvara specifically. Nepalese bronzes of the 11th century are solid cast and have an exceptionally high copper content in the alloy that makes the bronze difficult to manage during fabrication. The color achieved by the extra copper creates a distinctive warmth and softness in the sculpture. The flexed toes of the right foot and the swinging to one side of the gathered ends of his garment impart a sense of dynamism to his ongoing act of giving. His facial expression is sweet and placid but sharp, as though he is keenly aware of the sufferings of the world.",Type of artwork: Sculpture

Plantae Selectae:  No. 37 - Yucca,"Germany, 18th century","DescriptionA major problem in horticulture was the lack of a consistent system of classification. The first successful attempt to establish a common nomenclature was in 1724 when 20 London nurserymen published a list of all plants grown in their nurseries. Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus’s Systema Naturae was published in 1735; it classified 7,700 plants by their botanic structure and gave them universally applicable two-part Latin names.

A female figure standing in a landscape holding a four-stringed “khuuchir” and a lotus,,"DescriptionStanding over flowering sprigs, holding a lotus like a scepter, the figure seems to magically impart fertility to a desert. In pan-Indian religious iconography (system of visual symbols that identify a figure), the lotus is held by the goddess of good fortune, prosperity, and abundance, who is frequently associated with ideal kingship. The stringed instrument recalls the Indian goddess of learning and music, but here it is of a Mongolian type, as is the feather in her crown. Her garments are reminiscent of those worn by biblical and classical figures in European engravings. This painting combines Indian, European, and Mongolian references.",Type of artwork: Painting
Column Base,,"DescriptionThis base comes from the palatial city of Madinat al-Zahra near Cordoba (Spain) which was begun by caliph Abd al-Rahman III (r. 912–61) around 936.

Brush with Carved Design,,"DescriptionIn China, access to political power was granted to those who passed the civil service examinations, a system that offered official service only at a high level of education. Chinese literati-officials, whose daily routine involved administrative work in an office, enjoyed precious objects on their writing desks that offered distraction and demonstrated good taste. By the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties, these utensils of the literati studio became also collectibles and were treasured as artworks.A brush, like this one, was essential for both administrative tasks and for artistic creation. The bamboo brush handle and cap were carved in shallow relief with branches, leaves, birds, and flowers. The brush tip was made from fine white animal hairs.",Type of artwork: Wood
Mirakel (Miracle),"Austria, Vienna","DescriptionNamed for the technical “miracle” that is this textile’s stacked rotating design, Mirakel is still produced by the Stockholm-based interior design firm Svenskt Tenn. Though the design is now screenprinted in Sweden, this textile fragment was block printed by Josef Frank’s Austrian firm Haus & Garten, giving it an earlier production date. The design features imaginary flowers and sinuous vines, signature design elements of Frank’s textiles.",Type of artwork: Textile
Hanging fragment with boar head,,"DescriptionThis fragment preserves parts of two distinct designs. In the lower section, a boar's head is framed by a pearl roundel; to left and right are fragments of two other roundels, and in the spandrels are segments of stylized flowers. In the field above are four feet of what must have been a rather large-scale horse standing in a meadow of flowers of which only fragments remain. A fifth hoof, turned in the opposite direction, indicates that originally the composition included a pair of horses addorsed. A double row of pearls occupies the spaces beneath the horses' feet, and a narrow plain band separates this field from the one below.",Type of artwork: Textile
Plaque,,"DescriptionCraftsmen modeled brass plaques like this in wax before casting them with hot metal. Molds pushed out figures’ general shapes, then details—such as this warrior’s staff and court sword (ẹbẹn)—were added by hand. Reflecting Benin’s global connections, the incised flowers may have Islamic or European origins. Called ebe-amẹn (river leaves) they are identified with Olókun, god of the waters. The interlaced side motifs may connect several early plaques also linked by topic and style. The palace plaques were in storage before the 1897 Siege of Benin. Recently, an art historian virtually reconstructed their former display in the palace based on their dimensions and imagery.",Type of artwork: Sculpture

In this tapestry, Zephyrus’s wings resemble those of a butterfly or moth rather than a bird. The ravishing landscape echoes Flora and Zephyrus as springtime divinities.

Prunus Vase (Meiping) with Blossoming Lotus,,"DescriptionAccording to 11th-century poet Zhou Dunyi, “all people like peonies, but I alone like the lotus because it emerges from the mud unstained.” The lotus is a symbol of purity and popular among Chinese literati and in Buddhism. This vase shows lotus flowers rising from the water’s surface depicted in elegant yet simple ripples. Made in a kiln at Jingdezhen in southern China, this vase is an example of the fahua technique—decoration with raised outlines produced by squeezing clay from a tube onto the vase’s surface. Colors are applied to fill the outlines before firing.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
Plantae Selectae:  No. 5 - Anona,"Germany, 18th century","DescriptionA major problem in horticulture was the lack of a consistent system of classification. The first successful attempt to establish a common nomenclature was in 1724 when 20 London nurserymen published a list of all plants grown in their nurseries. Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus’s Systema Naturae was published in 1735; it classified 7,700 plants by their botanic structure and gave them universally applicable two-part Latin names. From then on artists had to combine scientific accuracy with artistic skill. Many of Ehret’s flower portraits were copied by printmakers and published in the great botanical iconographies of his day.

A Barber Cleaning the Ear of a Courtesan,"Eastern India, Bengal, Kolkata, Kalighat","DescriptionPopular Kalighat paintings were made into woodcuts for mass printing and distribution. This image reveals the lifestyle of a new middle class of Indians who prospered under British rule. Holding a fancy hookah for pleasurable smoking, draped with jewels, wearing a glamorous sari, and with a flower tucked in her hair, she has the luxury of going to a barber to have her ears cleaned. The age of mechanical reproduction made a heavy impact on the new Indian middle class during the last decades of the 1800s. British magazines and periodicals were fashionable among Indian households, and they served to shape their taste for British and Western styles and commodities. Cheaper prints such as this woodcut were made for more popular distribution. They spoke to aspirations or observations by a broader, less privileged community.",Type of artwork: Print

Pair of Qingbai Ware Bowls with Covers,,"DescriptionWhile dark-glazed ceramics resemble black lacquer ware, and celadons were often compared to green jade, white or bluish-white glazed stoneware imitates silver. Here, broad silver bands around the bowls’ rims accentuate their precious appearance. The incised petals are inspired by lotus flowers and the domed covers by their circular leaves. The lotus motif often indicates the use of an object in a Buddhist context, in which it is a symbol of purity as its flowers emerge unsullied from the mud of lakes and ponds. Alternatively, these bowls may have been used to hold food at banquets.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
"The soldier receives a garland of roses from his wife which will remain fresh as long as she is faithful, from a Tuti-nama (Tales of a Parrot): Fourth Night",,"DescriptionUpon his departure, a warrior’s wife gives him roses that stay fresh as long as she remains faithful in his absence. This story reveals a connection between virtue and nature: the flowers remain fresh because of her loyalty.The stories in the Tuti-nama reveal the interconnectedness of Indian, Persian, and Central Asian populations.

Farmer's Wife,"America, 20th century","DescriptionWorking in the mid-20th century through the 1980s, the social-realist painter Robert Gwathmey's work mingles memories of his pleasant childhood in the South with his observations of the physical and financial hardships of primarily Black, poor Southern farm workers as an adult. Gwathmey's lens—that of a white man living in New York City and educated in Europe—brought a modernist sensibility to scenes that focused on individual figures or family groups. In Farmer's Wife, he employed expressive distortion of the human figure and a reduction and simplification of forms derived from European Modernism, using flat areas of color in a repetitive and simplified color palette that draws connections between the sitter's skin and dress, the flower bouquet, and the table. The artful arrangement of flowers and the table, with its heart-shaped decoration, reveal the sitter's industry and resilience, just as her hands and face suggest a lifetime of hard work. Gwathmey said of the image that it ""is my response to a lady of character who has borne the scars of outrageous circumstance and has refused to be destroyed.""",Type of artwork: Print

It tells of a young nobleman’s journey into the lonely countryside, far from the capital city of Heian-kyō (Kyoto). There he came upon a small stream, the banks of which were covered with blooming irises, on which the artist has chosen to focus our attention.

Brünnhilde in Twilight of the Gods,"France, 19th century","DescriptionThis print shows Odilon Redon’s passion for the music of 19th-century German composer Richard Wagner. Brünnhilde is a main character in the final chapter of Wagner’s The Ring of the Nibelung, an epic four-part operatic piece composed over several decades. Created after Redon’s extensive experimentation with and mastery of lithography, the print reveals the medium’s similarity to drawing in the range of marks used to sketch its subject. Redon delicately outlined flowers in the background and crosshatched to highlight Brünnhilde’s face before turning his crayon on its side to darken her hair and chest.",Type of artwork: Print
Apothecary's Bottle,,"DescriptionThis white porcelain bottle is decorated with cobalt blue birds and flowers. While inspired by functional apothecary jars used in medieval pharmacies, this bottle was likely decorative. Its underside has the initials IC, which are almost certainly those of Johannes Camphuys (1634-1695), who was in charge of the Dutch East India Company’s operations in Deshima in 1671.

Plum Tree,"Japan, Edo period","DescriptionOgata Kōrin had to think through his design carefully to create these white plum blossoms and deliver their effect, as he used the reserve technique—where selected areas of the painting surface are left unpainted—to achieve it. He probably roughed in the tree before applying an ink wash to the entire silk surface, except where he intended to place the flowers. He likely then returned to articulate the petals and, in some cases, the pistils and stamens. The composition shows the tree twisting out of view, only to return with a branch of new growth jabbing forth from an old, broken limb, thereby heightening the visual impact of the blossoms.",Type of artwork: Painting

as the man makes a tender touch, an invitation
to love. This artist pared down a garden of love
to an arbor with a low fence, a vase of flowers,
and a basin of water holding a jug of wine and
cup. The love displayed in the garden is chaste,
as intended. This is apparent by the wine in
the water bath, suggesting cooled desire; the
carnations in the vase, symbols of virginity;
and the woman’s small dog, a sign of fidelity.",Type of artwork: Print
"Portrait of a kneeling holy man, from the Prince Salim Album","Mughal India, court of Akbar","DescriptionOne of the few surviving works that appear to have been made by an artist brought from Iran by Akbar’s father, Humayun, shortly after his arrival in Mughal India, this page was mounted into the Prince Salim Album in his breakaway court in Allahabad. The flowing lyrical contour lines, penetrating expression, and soft yet wiry texture of the beard reveal the hand of a master. The verse written above and below the painting is a quotation from a poetic sermon of the Persian author Sana’i, who lived about 1100: If it were greed that led you to acquire learning, then be afraid, For at night, a thief with a torch can take away the choicest goods! The calligraphy suggests that the kneeling figure is a charlatan holy man who wears the blue robe of a Sufi mystic and acts with humility and piety for monetary gain rather than sincerity of devotion.",Type of artwork: Painting
Lily and Butterflies,"China, Yuan dynasty","DescriptionThe bird is represented in pale ink, probably sketched in before the darker ink was used to finish the rock. Like the butterfly and moth above, his tail feathers echo the bamboo as well as the leaves and petals of the flowers. The Chinese wagtail can connote brotherly love. The daylily was used for various pharmaceutical purposes, especially for deadening pain in childbirth. It was also considered efficacious in relieving grief and aiding in the production of sons. The lily is in fact the real subject of this painting: it is the common symbol for motherly love. Hence, the lingering of the butterfly over a lily can signify a son's love, devotion, and yearning for his mother—the refuge from worldly woes.",Type of artwork: Painting

The subjects Li Shan chose to paint—orchids, bamboo, pines, and flowers—reflected his literati background. Five Pine Trees, painted late in his career, is an unconventional work.

"Royal Reception in a Landscape, left folio from the double frontispiece of a Shahnama (Book of Kings) of Firdausi (Persian, about 940–1019 or 1025)",,"DescriptionThe royal feast is set in a green landscape dotted with flowers and blossoming bushes against a gold sky with wisps of blue and white clouds. The group of figures in the upper left includes a falconer, horses, attendants, and two hunting cheetahs, while servers transport food and drink in gold and ceramic vessels, some presumably Chinese blue and white porcelain. Possibly this banquet was offered after a courtly hunt, a prestigious symbol of power and wealth. Among the groups of men sitting on elaborate carpets are three Chinese officials, identifiable by their black hats, kneeling together on the ground. Although their presence indicates the presence of foreign cultures within the Timurid court, the painting also reveals that not all are welcome to the feast; in the bottom half of the page a guard wields a stick to drive a group of men out of the garden.",Type of artwork: Manuscript

Trophy Cup and Cover,"England, 18th century","DescriptionSilver fulfilled a prominent role in projecting wealth, status, power, and ritual in British life during the 1600s and 1700s. Elaborate forms such as this trophy, with its swags of flowers, neoclassical rosettes, acanthus spears, and acorn finial, not only represented wealth in its sheer silver weight but also provided royal and aristocratic owners a surface for displaying engraved coats of arms. Engraved on one side of this trophy cup can be found the arms of Robert Grosvenor (1767–1845), the first Marquess of Westminster, and Lady Eleanor Egerton (1770–1846), whom he married in 1794, a year after the trophy’s completion.

Chrysanthemums and Cabbage,"China, Ming dynasty","DescriptionOn an autumn day in Beijing, Tao Cheng had a gathering with a group of scholar-officials and created two paintings in a spontaneous, casual style. The first depicts chrysanthemums, slender bamboo stalks, and a rock in monochrome ink. Tao applied light colors for the second painting that depicts cabbage. Tao deliberately placed the images on the first sections of the paper so that his honorable guests could add their poetic inscriptions inspired by his imagery. In the first section to the right, all seven poetic inscriptions refer to the beloved poet and recluse Tao Qian (also called Tao Yuanming, AD 365–427) who was particularly known for his profound love for chrysanthemum flowers. Most of the inscriptions in the second section express sympathy for the poor, since cabbage is the main ingredient in their humble food.

Paintings after Ancient Masters,"China, Ming dynasty","DescriptionThe twenty paintings in this double album by Chen Hongshou include landscapes, figures, and flowers. It also has one leaf featuring a woman, an often-used subject not found in the other albums from the latter part of his career. His late works are wonderful summations of Chen's peculiar and quirky art—archaistic, hyper-refined—but without accompanying shallowness or sentimentality.His figures and landscapes in the late albums are miniaturized, not unlike the small Chinese gardens, or the carefully selected small table rocks or old roots used for contemplation to see the world in miniature. This loss of scale is quite deliberate and reflects the psychological situation of a depressed class like the Ming loyalist officials and scholars, deprived of their integrity and honor, and forced to lead a diminished and restricted existence.",Type of artwork: Painting

No longer with the ambition to conquer, like the Turko-Mongol rulers Timur (d. 1405) and Babur (c. 1530), the first Mughal emperor, these migrants are seeking new lands in which to settle as immigrants. The highly detailed subjects are placed against a plain background, as if the figures were designed for objective study and categorization. Indian artists made works such as this for the British in India, who were interested in collecting accurate visual records of flora, fauna, and ethnic groups who inhabited the land they colonized in 1858.",Type of artwork: Painting
Pipa (Loquats),"China, Yangzhou, Qing dynasty","DescriptionThe loquat is a plant native to China that produces a juicy, yellow fruit in early summer.

Tiger Hunt of Raja Ram Singh II,,"DescriptionWith the dramatic cliffs of Kotah as the backdrop, one massive tiger is shown at three rapidly successive moments in time. Having been lured out of the forest by the dead bull at the upper left, the king’s men drive the tiger to the riverbanks with drums, trumpets, arrows, and muskets. The king himself, Ram Singh II who ruled the small kingdom of Kotah from 1827 until 1866, is shown in the act of delivering the fatal shot from the prow of a boat, as the ladies and nobles of the court look on in admiration. The tiger sinks into the river, from where he will be retrieved and offered with all honor and ceremony to a religious leader who will see to it that the shakti, or divine creative energies embodied by the tiger, be translated into blessings and prosperity for the kingdom. This example of a ritual tiger hunt belongs to a genre known as Rajput painting, made at the courts of kingdoms in Rajasthan that were under the aegis of the Mughal empire. The establishment of court painting workshops in the Rajput kingdoms was inspired by the imperial Mughal model, but each court developed its own distinctive style.",Type of artwork: Painting

Bifolio from a Book of Hours: Initial V with Floral Border (recto); Text (verso),,"DescriptionThe word dirge, today meaning a mournful hymn for funerals, comes from the opening Latin in the Office of the Dead, seen just after the decorative letter A at upper left. During the Middle Ages, dirge became the shortened way to refer to the Office of the Dead. Although primarily recited at funerals, the office was also prayed at home as a reminder of mortality and a protection against sudden death.

"Tigers Chasing Deer, with Dragon",,"DescriptionThe design of this Central Asian tapestry is a synthesis of Western and Chinese elements. Bands of pearls and split palmettes and the deer with mushroom-shaped antlers originated in Iran and Sogdiana but migrated to China during the Tang dynasty (618-907). Although these motifs disappeared from Chinese art after the fall of the Tang, they survived in Central Asia for centuries. The dragon is Chinese in origin, but has a Central Asian form (particularly its extended snout). Also characteristic of Central Asia are the placement of the dragon among flowers, the liveliness of the animals, the use of floral sprays of varying scale and species, and the brilliant colors. The combination of unrelated patterns (bands of tigers chasing deer next to the dragon among flowers) probably evolved from the ancient practice of applying borders to garments with contrasting designs.",Type of artwork: Textile
"Varaha, Boar Incarnation of Vishnu",,"DescriptionIn the myth of Vishnu's boar incarnation, or avatar, a demon hid the earth at the bottom of the primordial ocean. The god took the form of a boar (varaha) and rescued her. Even with his legs missing, this sculpture conveys the powerful lunge of his body as he raises the earth to safety. Personified as the goddess Bhu, one of Vishnu's two wives, she does not appear helpless; perched on his raised elbow, she returns his adoring gaze. This image was popular among kings of India, who appear to have appropriated it as a metaphor for their own conquest over new territories, as though the king, like Vishnu, rescued the land and raised it to safety and prosperity.",Type of artwork: Stone

Poem on Plum,"Korea, Joseon dynasty","DescriptionFor Yi Hwang, a celebrated scholar and poet in 16th-century Korea, writing poems was an escape from partisan politics.

In his numerous poems, Yi used plum blossom imagery to express his feelings. The poem on this hanging scroll reads: “Wishing to fly away, red leaves left the mountain villa. Their large sleeves are frosted due to blue clouds. The clouds in the sky look upright, which are beyond human beings’ ability. The plum tree whispered to me that [the leaves] fell from the wind and landed on the fence.” The mountain villa in this poem may refer to the Dosan Academy, a Confucian school that Yi established after his retirement, and the red leaves of the plum blossom are probably Yi’s poetic personification.",Type of artwork: Calligraphy

The Heroine Who Waits Anxiously for Her Absent Lover (Utka Nayika),,"DescriptionInspired by devotional poetry that likens the waiting for divine favor to that of a woman alone in the forest waiting for her lover, Pahari painters mastered portrayals of this subject. Darkness has fallen, but the moon and stars and jasmine flowers brighten the night. However, monsoon clouds approach in the distance, suggesting impending danger and misery.

Young Woman Reading,"France, 19th century","DescriptionPrimarily a sculptor of medals, Charpentier used embossing techniques to lend three-dimensionality to this print featuring his typical subject matter featuring everyday life. Charpentier was also aware of Japanese woodcuts circulating in Paris during the late 19th century, which provided a precedent for using embossing to create pattern and a three-dimensional effect on a flat sheet of paper.

In a simplified seminaturalistic style, swaying branches support an exuberant array of blossoms in the Safavid tradition while the botanical accuracy of European prints inspired flora in varied angles and stages of maturity. Although celebrated in Iranian poetry for centuries, flowers were not featured in paintings and textiles until the 1640s, inspired by European herbals.

Vase,"France, 19th century","DescriptionIn style, the vase is resoundingly eclectic. It derives its form from a slightly modified ancient Greek amphora-a two-handled jar having a narrow neck. Contemporaries described its style as neo-grec (new Greek) or Byzantine. Today, however, we would not choose those terms. It is true that the surface decoration of the vase is based upon the scrolling pattern of a classical acanthus design-an arrangement of leaves and flowers-but the sharp, spiky details point to possible Islamic modifications of this pattern. The colors of the enamels are related to medieval European examples, particularly 12th-century Netherlandish work from the Mosan region. The decoration of this vase exemplifies a technical innovation introduced by the Barbedienne firm around 1860. In casting the metal from which the piece is formed, many small grooves were created on its surface. Later these grooves and other broader recessed areas were filled with colored enamels to create a predetermined ornamental design.",Type of artwork: Metalwork

Chen's late works are wonderful summations of his peculiar and quirky art—archaistic, hyper-refined—but without accompanying shallowness or sentimentality.His figures and landscapes in the late albums are miniaturized, not unlike the small Chinese gardens, or the carefully selected small table rocks or old roots used for contemplation to see the world in miniature.

This miniature depicts the moment the cross is raised. In the foreground, thuggish brutes struggle to bring it upright. The skull of Adam at the foot of the cross signifies that Golgotha was Adam's burial place. In the background, a vivid blue sky recedes into pink as it meets the horizon and a distant town.

Pair of Boots,,"DescriptionThe fabric and tailoring of garments have always defined social status. For these boots, different outer fabrics were used: a patterned silk for the leg portion, and tapestry (kesi) for the foot. Since both were considered luxury fabrics, they were pieced together from remnants too precious to discard. Consequently, the silk pattern was not used in relation to the form of the boot. By contrast, these boots would have been made for a court official, not a member of the imperial family. The patterned silk was woven with geese flanking a vase of flowers on a stand and surrounded by cloud scrolls. The Chinese motif of flowers arranged in a vase was adopted by the Liao during the 11th century and indicates an 11th- or early 12th-century date for the boots.",Type of artwork: Garment

Hot wax is applied with a tool known as a canting and a design is hand drawn with incredible skill. This sarong was then dyed with indigo, a well sought after and culturally important natural dye. Areas on the fabric with wax will not accept the indigo dye, hence the term wax-resist.",Type of artwork: Textile

His late works are wonderful summations of Chen's peculiar and quirky art—archaistic, hyper-refined—but without accompanying shallowness or sentimentality.His figures and landscapes in the late albums are miniaturized, not unlike the small Chinese gardens, or the carefully selected small table rocks or old roots used for contemplation to see the world in miniature.

Plum Blossoms,"China, Qing dynasty","DescriptionA native of Anhui province, Wang Shishen was a professional painter who specialized in plum blossoms. He moved to Yangzhou in the late 1720s to seek patrons. Here, the daring composition of a flowering plum branch is balanced through the addition of four poems. Wang’s poems evoke nostalgia for the forgotten Six Dynasties period and the glorious Sui dynasty, during which the Grand Canal was built while Yangzhou was the southern capital of the empire. Other inscriptions in the upper part of the painting allude to the fact that Wang had developed blindness in one eye, probably at the time he conceived this painting.",Type of artwork: Painting
Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur (reigned 1635–1678),,"DescriptionMughal emperors forged alliances with the Hindu rulers of territories under their control by offering them positions of military authority within the Mughal court.

Because the printmakers’ unauthorized use of gold leaf was eventually caught, only a limited number of gilded examples were produced.

She has made intimate enclosures of flowering branches for their tryst, she pleads with a picture of him, and she lays out blossoms and liquor under a tree in preparation. Her confidante makes an appeal to Krishna who sits under a tree at right, seemingly unmoved and dispassionate. The viewer is meant to put oneself in the place of Radha, and feel her intense longing for Krishna. Even when it seems like the god does not come when he promises, that he does not care, the devotee, like Radha, should continue to wait and prepare to receive him.",Type of artwork: Painting

Gunakali Ragini,,"DescriptionPaintings made in the city of Jaipur took on a confectionary palette that became popular among newly expanded markets around India and abroad. With the disintegration of centralized imperial power, the Rajput kingdom of Jaipur began independently producing art that had mass appeal. Sets of paintings by royal court artists, such as the Ragamala series from which this page came, were made for sale, rather than for the private collection of the king. The revenues from their sale ensured the prosperity of the kingdom. The verse associated with Gunakali Ragini, a wintertime raga, states that the heroine “sets mandara flowers in a golden jar and seated, plucks them, with her mind fixed on love’s sport.”",Type of artwork: Painting

This is indicated by two figures—a clear-sighted figure embracing a blindfolded figure—standing on a globe in the upper center and also by the musicians. The angels play soft-sounding instruments (harpsichords, harps, viole da barccio, and flutes) while earthy figures play loud instruments (tambours and hunting horns). The chasuble was most likely part of a liturgical set commissioned for a wedding. This entire chasuble is embroidered with silk and metal thread laid over linen and stitched in place.

The artist attended the production on more than 20 occasions, arriving just in time to see the final bolero in which Lender’s multilayered skirts created an explosion of bright pink and green tulle as she danced.

Blessed Lord Buddha,,"DescriptionThe central figure of the Buddha, radiating light and the flame of enlightenment, is flanked by his four main disciples: Sariputra and the blue Moggallana on his left, and Ananda and Anuruddha on his right. Below him is the earth goddess holding a pot of water on her head. To her right are three guardians of Sri Lanka: Kataragama (or Skanda) with six heads and twelve arms; the blue Vibhishana, younger brother of Ravana; and, smaller in size, may be Pattina holding an anklet and neem leaf. On the opposite side are three deities: Sumana, the four-faced Brahma, and four-armed Shiva with trident. Arranged around two depictions of the bodhi tree under which the Buddha reached enlightenment, rows of other monks bear garlands in veneration. Each of the standing protector divinities around the periphery grasps a bow and arrow.This painting evokes the appearance of 18th- to 19th-century murals in Sri Lankan Buddhist temple interiors, such as those at Dumbulla, with its rows of golden figures. It was probably part of a domestic shrine, along with small sculptures of the Buddha, palm-leaf manuscripts of Pali scriptures, incense, oil lamps, bells, and other offerings such as food, flowers, and water. The varnish that covers the painting may have been intended to shield it from the environment of an active place of worship.",Type of artwork: Painting
Fragment,"Italy, Florence, 16th century","DescriptionThe Madonna sits upon a throne with the Christ Child standing on her knee.  He is steadied by his mother, turning delicately to grasp the Virgin's robe for support.  On the left is St. Francis, identified by his stigmata.  On the right, St. Anthony Abbot is identified by his monk's robe and T-shaped walking stick.  The brown robes of the saints, the purple of the Virgin's tunic (a shade characteristic of the artist), and the flesh tones of the figures contrast strongly against the bright blue background.  In the semicircular sky behind the figures, three winged cherub heads emerge, representing a host of angels.  
The inclusion of St. Francis in this altarpiece honors the saint, suggesting that the altarpiece may have been originally built into the wall of a Franciscan institution in Tuscany.  Two shields bearing the Borgherini family crest appear in the lower portion of the altarpiece's border, further suggesting that the chapel for which this altarpiece was made was likely owned or endowed by the family.  
Glazed terracotta is both durable and decorative and the gleaming white of this piece would have stood out in the darkness of a church.  The medium was made popular by Renaissance artist Luca della Robbia and came into fashion as a substitute for expensive carved marble.  A rounded arch frame embellished with fruit and flower garlands as well as egg-and-dart and cord moldings accompanied the work when it was acquired, but was later determined not to be original and removed.  Buglioni's work bears the influence of the della Robbias, particularly in the simple color scheme.  Buglioni likely worked in the studio of Luca's nephew, Andrea, where he would have learned the technique of glazing terracotta.",Type of artwork: Sculpture

Leaf Excised from a Book of Hours: Decorated Initial H,"North Netherlands, Zwolle(?), 15th century","DescriptionThe difficulty in localizing Dutch manuscripts of the second half of the 15th century is formidable. Many shared or exchanged characteristics are found, particularly in terms of page layout, border decoration, and initial design. The present leaf contains borders embellished with brightly colored flowers (columbines) and acanthus leaves filled in with gold bezants, tiny green leaves, and little black dots. Though different in palette, these elements bear closest resemblance to borders and initials produced by a group of artists associated with the Zwolle Bible (Utrecht, Universiteitsbibliotheek, MS. 31). The original illuminators are believed to have worked within the Monastery of the Canons Regular at Agnietenberg. This leaf is painted in an associated style by an artist who must have been familiar with the Zwolle group.",Type of artwork: Manuscript
Queen of the May,"England, 19th century","DescriptionA major figure in the development of British photography, Cameron elevated the portrait to new artistic heights. She never opened a commercial studio or accepted commissions, but she was one of the first photographers to sell her photographs through a fine art gallery. Friends, neighbors, family, and servants were cajoled into modeling for portraits as themselves and as allegorical figures from history, religion, mythology, and literature. Little is known about Emily Peacock, who posed here as the protagonist in The May Queen by Britain’s poet laureate Alfred Tennyson.

Pair of Boots,,"DescriptionThe fabric and tailoring of garments have always defined social status. For these boots, different outer fabrics were used: a patterned silk for the leg portion, and tapestry (kesi) for the foot.

Consequently, the silk pattern was not used in relation to the form of the boot, as seen in some other imperial boots. By contrast, these boots would have been made for a court official, not a member of the imperial family. The patterned silk was woven with geese flanking a vase of flowers on a stand and surrounded by cloud scrolls.

Fragment,"Italy, Florence, 16th century","DescriptionThe Madonna sits upon a throne with the Christ Child standing on her knee.  He is steadied by his mother, turning delicately to grasp the Virgin's robe for support.  On the left is St. Francis, identified by his stigmata.  On the right, St. Anthony Abbot is identified by his monk's robe and T-shaped walking stick.  The brown robes of the saints, the purple of the Virgin's tunic (a shade characteristic of the artist), and the flesh tones of the figures contrast strongly against the bright blue background.  In the semicircular sky behind the figures, three winged cherub heads emerge, representing a host of angels.  
The inclusion of St. Francis in this altarpiece honors the saint, suggesting that the altarpiece may have been originally built into the wall of a Franciscan institution in Tuscany.

His late works are wonderful summations of Chen's peculiar and quirky art--archaistic, hyper-refined--but without accompanying shallowness or sentimentality.His figures and landscapes in the late albums are miniaturized, not unlike the small Chinese gardens, or the carefully selected small table rocks or old roots used for contemplation to see the world in miniature.

Pendant,,"DescriptionPendants were used extensively in Buddhist settings where they were attached to almost anything needing decoration: ritual objects, canopies, valances, pillars, and other architectural components. They could be made in a variety of ways. This example consists of a heading and six tiers, each embroidered separately and then attached, one to the next. The earliest known pendant of this type was found in Central Asia and dates from the Tang dynasty (AD 618-907).

Still Life with Cantaloupe,"America, 19th century","DescriptionBrown's early works were softly painted, romantic landscapes, but in the 1860s he turned almost exclusively to still lifes. He renounced the fluid style of his earlier landscapes and began to paint carefully contrived arrangements of fruit and flowers with almost photographic clarity. Brown became one of a number of painters to gain fame through reproductions made with the new printing process of chromolithography (a multicolor lithograph in which each color is printed from a separate stone or metal plate).",Type of artwork: Painting

A central image of the demon-queller Zhong Kui was flanked by this painting and one of a red plum and bamboo. The paintings would have been suitable to hang after the turn of the new year, when Zhong Kui would drive out evil demons, and the year’s first flowers were in bloom.

On the other hand, recumbent animals looking back are a Central Asian image that migrated to northern China.

Lampas with floral medallions in ogival lattice,,"DescriptionThis signature Turkish brocaded silk has a classic elegance associated with the artistic height of the 1500s. The prominent golden medallions and ogival (curved) lattice contrast with exceptionally delicate Turkish flowers—tulips, roses, carnations, and hyacinths—which all grow on a single vine. The symmetrical design and two complete medallions with lattices across the width are typical Turkish features of fine brocaded silks. Its original function is uncertain. Possibly it was intended for an imperial kaftan, a garment consisting of a long gown with sleeves reaching below the hands, examples of which are preserved in the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, the imperial center of the vast and wealthy Ottoman Empire.",Type of artwork: Textile

Dead Child On a Sofa,,"DescriptionThis carefully staged daguerreotype of a dead child is an outstanding example of a very common subject: the postmortem portrait. Using the stylistic conventions of the day, the unidentified artist successfully created a visually pleasing scene, despite the nature of the image. Dressed in white with a bouquet of flowers on the chest, the child, seen in profile, reclines on an elaborately patterned sofa. Delicate flesh tones were added to the cheek and arm, suggestive of a healthy child sleeping. The high rate of infant mortality throughout the 19th century made this variety of portraiture common, satisfying the emotional need of the parents to have a lasting memory of a loved one.",Type of artwork: Photograph

I followed the metamorphosis of these monsters from their virility while they were alive to the hollow, sun-bleached shells lying, like wilted flowers, on the pebble beach.”",Type of artwork: Print

Here, smaller creatures above use flowers or leaves as musical instruments, and their larger counterparts below dance a galop. An Insect Ball was one of more than 50 drawings that the artist made for wood-engraved reproduction in Le Magasin pittoresque (The Picturesque Store), a popular encyclopedic review edited by Grandville's friend Edouard Charton.

Although they admired his talent, his English colleagues found Bennett had a difficult personality, and his stay at the Doulton factory was brief. By 1876 he was in New York, bringing with him the concepts of the English Aesthetic Movement: muted colors and great naturalism in the depiction of birds and flowers.",Type of artwork: Ceramic

The dominant botanical artist in the mid-18th century, Ehret settled in England where the nobility clamored to receive his instruction. He commented in his autobiography, “If I could have divided myself into twenty parts I could still have had my hands full.” Ehret struck a fine compromise between the artist and the scientist. “While he did not slavishly imitate what he saw, neither did he allow his feeling for the color and design of flowers distract him from the fundamentals of plant structure,” confirms Wilfrid Blunt, author of The Art of Botanical Illustration.

Hollyhock Garden,"America, 20th century","DescriptionBaumann began Hollyhock Garden around 1914 when living in Brown County, Indiana. After settling in Santa Fe, he reworked the scene in about 1919, adding Southwestern touches, such as transforming the wooden Indiana farmhouse with a shingle roof into adobe buildings with tile roofs. He must have referenced Hollyhock Garden in 1927 when making the color woodcut Hoosier Garden, since there are many correspondences between them, including the picket fence with its profusion of yellow and orange flowers and the porch chair, which lurks ghostlike beneath a thin layer of paint in the drawing.",Type of artwork: Drawing
Large Jar with Peonies and Chrysanthemums,,"DescriptionJapan took China’s place as Europe’s main source for export porcelain around the middle of the 17th century because the transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasty in China disrupted trade. The Dutch East India Company began to buy Japanese porcelain in 1650 and exported approximately 50,000 Japanese porcelains in 1659. Such large jars demonstrate how artists took the birds and flowers motifs found in paintings and applied them to the blue and white porcelain called sometsuke. The Japanese transformed typical Chinese Jingdezhen blue and white porcelain into a spacious composition. This design shows the changing of the seasons. One side depicts a peony blossom in the spring, and the other side continues with chrysanthemums and an orchid in the autumn.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
Eagles,,"DescriptionTwo eagles, painted in fine brushwork, perch on top of rocks surrounded by water, flowering camellia, and other vegetation, brushed in sweeping and broad strokes. Among birds, a favorite subject in Chinese painting, depictions of eagles can be traced back to at least the fourth century.Due to dramatic sociopolitical changes during the foreign-ruled Yuan (1279–1368) and native Ming dynasties, an elaborate symbolic language of the eagle developed. It can represent a vicious attacker, a courageous hero, or an enlightened emperor. In this painting, the two eagles are depicted peacefully resting in a lofty position, perhaps an idealistic image for a wise emperor and empress.",Type of artwork: Painting
Southern Spring,"America, 19th century","DescriptionIn 1943, the artist Hobson Pittman wrote to William M. Milliken, then director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, to express his pleasure that this work had been purchased by the museum. He explained that ""the canvas you have chosen...is one that I enjoyed painting very much indeed. It came after a visit with my family in North Carolina several years ago. I remember so well as I went down on the train, drinking in every bit of the landscape from the windows, noticing the flowering trees becoming fuller and fuller as I got nearer to my home. The yellow and reddish browns in the earth against the many tones and shades of greens and the blooming trees made me want to stop, then and there, and start painting. But that was not possible until my return. So from memory and imagination, the painting was done.""",Type of artwork: Painting
The Immaculate Conception,"Germany, Würzburg, 18th century","DescriptionThis work has been associated with Johann Pieter Wagner, one of the leading Austrian sculptors of the second half of the 18th century.   Because of its small size, it was most likely either a model for a larger altarpiece or an object designed for private devotion. Gold serves as celestial decoration around the border and on the figures. The Virgin Mary stands upon billowing clouds held up by angels, a variant on the Madonna of Victory, which features Mary or Jesus holding a spear. Mary holds the infant Jesus, while trampling a serpent-symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. The holy child holds a bouquet of flowers, representing his ability to bestow grace, expressing the benevolence associated with the cult of the Immaculate Conception.",Type of artwork: Sculpture
Stems,"America, 20th century","DescriptionFor more than forty years, Lee Friedlander has created ""social landscapes,"" images of jazz musicians, monuments, city streets, suburban backyards, and factory workers. Yet his portraits of family and friends, nudes, and still lifes demonstrate his versatility. This photograph, depicting the stems of cut flowers in a reflective glass bowl, comes from a series that Friedlander made while recovering from knee surgery. Through his keen powers of observation and conceptualization, he transformed the stems into a striking abstract composition of bold geometric forms, bathed in warm, atmospheric light.

Honeysuckle,"England, Early 20th century","DescriptionWilliam Morris’s daughter May called Honeysuckle “the most truly Morrisian in character of all his pattern-making . . . the most mysterious and poetic—the very symbol of a garden tangle.” Like many Morris textiles from this period, Honeysuckle has a mirrored pattern. At 29 3/4 inches high and 34 3/4 inches wide, this repeat was unusually broad, spanning almost the entire width of the loom. Morris believed that large patterns were more restful to the eye than small patterns, even when used to decorate modestly sized rooms. Designs from this period are a testament to the delight he took in his garden at Kelmscott Manor; he favored the charm of native English flowers above exotic specimens.",Type of artwork: Textile

Briar Rose (Dornröschen),"Germany, 19th century","DescriptionFairy tales, folklore, and legends were understood as an important aspect of national and cultural heritage in 19th-century Germany. The interest in folk tales began as a literary phenomenon, but it soon infiltrated the visual arts. In his paintings and prints, Neureuther illustrated fairy tales and ballads of the period. In Grimm’s fairy tale ""Briar Rose,"" a princess and her kingdom are condemned to 100 years of sleep. According to the story, around the palace grew a thick hedge of briars, which every year grew higher until the castle was hidden from view.

Four Petunias,"America, 20th century","DescriptionWith the advent of World War I, Blanche Lazzell and many other American artists returned home from Paris, where they had gone to study and work. In the summer of 1915, Lazzell moved to Provincetown, Massachusetts, on the tip of Cape Cod, to join several friends who had settled in this picturesque locale to experiment with their art. Influenced by Japanese color woodcuts (ukiyo-e), many of the artists were interested in producing woodcuts themselves. Lazzell's home and studio, built on a pier, could be recognized by its colorful displays of flowers grown from seeds in pots or started on climbing vines. A passionate gardener, many of her woodcuts depict brilliantly colored floral images. Although she made a small number of monotypes, these too reflect her continuous interest in botanical subjects.",Type of artwork: Print

Front of the New Mills,"England, 19th century","DescriptionCrome's work epitomizes the essence of British landscape art at the beginning of the 19th century, the moment of its greatest flowering. Rooted in an almost mystical commmunion with nature, the artist's purpose was to express the true naturalism of landscape, a realism of light, air, and weather not seen before. He became interested in etching because he understood its potential for spontaneity, yet he feared his etchings would not be admired because they were, by conventional standards, unfinished and sketchy. In fact, it is precisely the freedom of line, lack of rigidity, and open silvery quality of light that makes them so special and individual. Rather than using prints to just copy his paintings, Crome approached etching as a creative medium with which to capture the special beauty of his native Norwich countryside. It is in early impressions like this one, printed by Crome in small numbers, and now extremely rare, that the delicacy of his technique can be appreciated.",Type of artwork: Print
Our Lady of Good Counsel,"Spain, 17th century","DescriptionThis painting loosely and inventively depicts an actual chapel in the former Jesuit Imperial College in Madrid, which housed a Madonna and Child in gilded and painted wood, a focus of popular devotion. Pérez made temporary decorations for the Spanish court, none of which survive, but the fanciful architecture, curiously inverted obelisks, fruits and flowers, and pastel colors all stem from this side of his work. By representing a polychrome sculpture in two dimensions, Pérez further blurred boundaries between painting and sculpture. This intersection of the spiritual and the real worlds was important in Spanish art of the 1600s.",Type of artwork: Painting

Phoenixes and Paulownia,"Japan, Momoyama period","DescriptionThe immense heraldic birds on display in these byøbu reflect the Momoyama era's spirit of newly gained self-confidence and an affinity for grand expressive statements in painting, architecture, the textile and ceramic arts, as well as garden design. While that period preceded the arrival of prosperity, it clearly marked an extra---ordinary moment in Japanese cultural history, one frequently compared with the twelfth century of the Heian period. Through the extensive use of gold-foil backgrounds rather than the somber palette of carefully orchestrated ink tones evident in Muromachi byøbu, patrons colla-borated with artists as well as craftsmen in fostering a decidedly new look in much of Japanese painting. Here for instance there is no imaginary vista suggesting China's vast waterways and mountain ranges. The setting is composed instead of highly stylized lozenges of mineral green paint, suggesting the earth from which clumps of grass, flowering plants, and towering bamboo and paulownia trees emerge. Clusters of lumpy, blue-green rocks dotted with lichen provide stabilizing three-dimensional foils for these islands of vegetation as well as the all-encompassing flat, golden surface. The glorious artificiality of the setting precisely serves the artist's effort to compose a credible yet other-worldly vista for depicting the legendary phoenix gazing across the landscape at the pair of peacocks. Rather than an emblem of immortality, as it is in Western lore, in Japan the phoenix evolved out of its origins in Chinese mythology to become, by the sixteenth century, an auspicious symbol of political authority. Together with clusters of the distinctively shaped paulownia leaves, this long-tailed, mythical bird graced lacquerware as well as mural paintings, proclaiming an air of graceful com-mand. A characteristic infusion of temporality has been included also, through a seasonal flowering schema extending from spring to early summer (right) to fall and the advent of winter (left). Although traditionally attributed to the Tosa school master Tosa Mitsuyoshi (1539-1613), these byøbu possess neither seals nor signatures to confirm that authorship. Known for his jewel-like, modest-sized album paintings of courtly narratives such as The Tale of Genji, it is likely both studio training and contemporary fashions in patronage conspired to produce a good number of such byøbu.

Peacocks and Bamboo,"Japan, Momoyama period","DescriptionThe immense heraldic birds on display in these byøbu reflect the Momoyama era's spirit of newly gained self-confidence and an affinity for grand expressive statements in painting, architecture, the textile and ceramic arts, as well as garden design. While that period preceded the arrival of prosperity, it clearly marked an extra---ordinary moment in Japanese cultural history, one frequently compared with the twelfth century of the Heian period.

In the Forest,"France, 19th century","DescriptionWith its beautifully rendered trees, grassy slopes, and water bathed in late afternoon sunlight, this painting clearly suggests Nanteuil's love of nature. In 1837 he wrote to a friend: ""I often spend several hours . . . looking at beautiful plants with large leaves, cut out like sumptuous lace, tall grasses in ponds, their color silky and the beautiful reflections they make in the water, the little flowers with thousands of colours the ground is embroidered with, all provide me with a source of enjoyment."" Although the forest Nanteuil described seems very real, his painting includes a satyr. Seated on a stone near a stream, the half human, half goat mythological figure seems lost in the music he plays upon his pipes. Nanteuil is most famous for his lithographs and etchings; paintings by the artist are rather rare.",Type of artwork: Painting
Brocaded velvet with medallions in ogival lattice,,"DescriptionThis luxurious velvet is similar to fabrics worn by Turkish sultans on elaborate ceremonial occasions at the imperial Topkapi Palace in Istanbul during the 1500s. Such bold patterns and high quality served to symbolize the immense power and unfathomable wealth of the Ottoman Empire. The design in this velvet was adapted from Ottoman court art and assembled to create lively contrasts between large motifs that can be seen from a distance—medallion and lattice—and small designs that can only be admired up close—flowers and crowns. Only the latter was of foreign, Italian, origin. The velvet was probably used as an upholstery fabric, seamed to several identical lengths, to form an opulent cover for a divan (sofa) at the palace.",Type of artwork: Velvet
Portrait of Samuel Butler,"England, early 18th century","DescriptionBernard Lens III was the most renowned member of an artist dynasty. His namesake father was a printmaker, his grandfather a painter, and two of his own sons became artists. Lens III was a critical figure in miniature painting as the art form transitioned away from painting on vellum. During the first decade of the eighteenth century, he established ivory as the primary miniature support in Britain, probably having seen the pioneering work of Rosalba Carriera (1675–1757) brought to England from Venice during the flowering of the Grand Tour. The earliest known miniatures by Lens were painted on vellum around 1707, with examples on ivory appearing shortly thereafter. Lens spent his career in London, Bristol, and Bath while also traveling to the country estates of his influential patrons. He was painter to kings George I and George II, as well as drawing instructor to princesses Mary and Louise, the Duke of Cumberland, and Horace Walpole (1717–1797).The sitter, Samuel Butler, turns slightly to the left and has brown eyes. A small portion of his dull red coat is visible, and he wears a white lace cravat twisted around his neck in a loose knot—an essential element of a gentleman’s dress that was fashionable between the 1670s and 1690s and unlike the broad lace or linen collars that dominated in the early and mid-seventeenth century. A long, brown, curled wig falls past his shoulders, and one comma-shaped curl is arranged at the center of his forehead. Butler’s voluminous wig occupies half of the painted surface. During the 1660s gentlemen regularly wore wigs, and while they offered a practical solution to such predicaments as hair loss, graying, and lice, wigs were subject to the vicissitudes of fashion. The wig style seen here is that of the late seventeenth century. Around 1680 it became the norm to part the long wig at the center, which by 1700 resulted in two pronounced tufts on either side, a style not yet exhibited in this portrait.Butler was a poet and satirist popular at the court of King Charles II (reigned 1660–1685). He is primarily remembered as the author of Hudibras, a mock-heroic epic poem satirizing Puritanism written during the English civil war and published between 1663 and 1678.",Type of artwork: Portrait Miniature

Spring New Mexico,"America, 20th century","DescriptionBaumann was attracted to the crystalline light and mountain scenery of the Southwest. He was always searching for novel subject matter, like the adobe architecture and flowering trees in Spring New Mexico, and was enticed since “all of the Southwest was virgin territory to the artist.” Appreciating the cultural diversity that gave the area its special ambiance, Baumann noted about Santa Fe, “The town as a whole gave me the feeling of a fairly well-adjusted mixture of Spanish and Anglo culture, with the Indian as an interrupted civilization still pervading it all. It made for a unique situation not likely to be found anywhere else.”",Type of artwork: Print

Portrait of the Artist's Children Emma and Paul,"France, 18th century","DescriptionThis sensitive depiction of his children exhibits Laurent's ability to portray the psychological interiority of his subjects, young or old. The miniature shows Laurent's son and daughter in white chemise gowns with green ribbon accents. They both have striking blue eyes and slightly curled blond hair. The younger sibling tenderly holds the arm of the older one, who sits on a chair strewn with pink rose petals and inscribed with the artist's signature. The children are placed within an environment in which green foliage sprouts small blue and purple flowers. This organic setting reflects 18th-century Western philosophies of natural child rearing, characterized by treating childhood as a period of innocence distinct from adulthood and advocating that children not be treated as miniature adults but instead should have their naiveté celebrated. This philosophy influenced children's clothing. Instead of dressing children as small adults in constrictive costumes, both genders wore loose chemises, like the ones seen here, that encouraged mobility.",Type of artwork: Portrait Miniature
Leaf from a Book of Hours: Office of the Dead: Angel Chasing a Devil (recto),"France, Paris, 15th century","DescriptionThe elaborate floral and foliated borders of this leaf, decorating the top, bottom, and sides of both recto and verso, contain four separate elements: blue and gold acanthus leaves, gold-leaf ivy vines, sprays of flowers or fruit, and a grotesque. Here the margin prominently includes an illuminated roundel with an angel chasing a devil with a lance. As a time-saving device, illuminators in the 1450s and later would often paint identical borders on both sides of a leaf. The motifs would be drawn on one side and then traced on the other by holding the leaf against a window. The manuscript from which this leaf came is no longer intact. It included numerous painted roundels relating to the lives of Saint Catherine of Alexandria and the more obscure Saint Alexis. It is possible that the manuscript originally belonged to a married couple for whom these saints served as patrons.",Type of artwork: Manuscript

Nymphéa,"France, 20th century","DescriptionA prolific Parisian artist who enjoyed a three-decade career, Atget was one of the most important and original photographers active at the beginning of the 20th century. This sparkling landscape of a mass of white water lily blossoms (Nymphéa) is among Atget's best compositions, created in the 1920s, when he was at the height of his artistic prowess. This scene, full of luxurious botany, was probably taken in Bagatelle Park at the edge of Paris's Bois de Boulogne. He carefully focused on the floating plants and their sculptured flowers, detailing texture and shape. The early morning illumination created light and shadow patterns that enabled Atget to isolate flat, abstracted forms while simultaneously depicting a deep pictorial space. In this lush, purplish print, the lily pond shimmers with reflected shadows and brilliant highlights.",Type of artwork: Photograph

Shri Raga: An Illustration from a Ragamala Series,,"DescriptionThe verse associated with Shri Raga corresponds closely with this scene:   His body, bluish in hue, is marvelously built.  He is always graced with the company of auspicious Shri Lakshmi.  He sits on a throne of gold, and before him Narada sits playing on his vina.  He has decorated himself with garlands of flowers, and also with ornaments set with jewels.  Shri raga is thus conceived in sentiment, of whom all learned men sing praises. The horse-headed figure claps his hands and accompanies the sage, wearing saffron garments and playing on the stringed instrument called a vina. He may be derived from the courtly commander of Indra, seen in the Jain manuscripts. Poppies bloom in the formal garden below the pure white terrace, and they are echoed by the oranges set on the windows of the house at the upper right.",Type of artwork: Painting

Leaf from a Psalter and Prayerbook: Calendar Page with Peasant (verso),,"DescriptionThis leaf and three others in the collection represent the charming, intricate decoration found throughout the parent volume, its leaves now dispersed. Virtually every border, recto and verso, was decorated with liquid gold and highlighted with a variety of flowers, fruits, and vegetables—carnations, thistles, roses, violets, peas, melons—as well as cornucopias, satyrs, masks, insects, birds, etc. The decoration is particularly charming because of the little vignettes within the borders. These motifs depict a girl kneading bread, a cook ladling soup, a goose nibbling grapes off a vine, and a satyr with a horn. Such details would have been a sumptuous delight to the original owner. This was a highly personalized volume, apparently written and illuminated in North Germany. The prominent mention of Saint Godehard (died 1038), Bishop of Hildesheim, in the original manuscript suggests that it was produced in that city.",Type of artwork: Manuscript

Portrait of the Artist's Children Emma and Paul,"France, 18th century","DescriptionThis sensitive depiction of his children exhibits Laurent's ability to portray the psychological interiority of his subjects, young or old. The miniature shows Laurent's son and daughter in white chemise gowns with green ribbon accents. They both have striking blue eyes and slightly curled blond hair. The younger sibling tenderly holds the arm of the older one, who sits on a chair strewn with pink rose petals and inscribed with the artist's signature. The children are placed within an environment in which green foliage sprouts small blue and purple flowers. This organic setting reflects 18th-century Western philosophies of natural child rearing, characterized by treating childhood as a period of innocence distinct from adulthood and advocating that children not be treated as miniature adults but instead should have their naiveté celebrated. This philosophy influenced children's clothing. Instead of dressing children as small adults in constrictive costumes, both genders wore loose chemises, like the ones seen here, that encouraged mobility.",Type of artwork: Portrait Miniature

Cutting from a Missal: Initial O with Christ Performing an Exorcism,"Italy, Rome, 16th century","DescriptionThis initial is probably the O beginning the Introit for the Third Sunday in Lent, Occuli mei semper ad Dominum (My eyes are ever towards the Lord). The Gospel reading from that Sunday tells the story of Christ casting out a demon. The artist's style is easily recognized in the facial features, and in the borders, in which he typically mixed still-life motifs, scattered small red and blue flowers, strawberries, and simulated pearls and jewels. Matteo's life dates are not known. His career probably began in Milan in the 1490s, but his name occurs in the accounts of the d'Este family at Ferrara from 1502 to 1512. The climax of Matteo's career was his activity in Rome, where he was apparently responsible for a number of luxury illuminated liturgical manuscripts. In 1520 he illuminated a missal for Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, the future Pope Clement VII (1523–34). The initial shown here comes from another missal that he must have illuminated around the same time. This missal was most probably in the Sistine Chapel sacristy when it was sacked by Napoleon's troops in 1798.",Type of artwork: Manuscript
Single Leaf with Scenes from the Last Supper,"Flanders, Bruges","DescriptionBorn either in Ghent or Antwerp in 1483, Simon Bening became one of the most famous manuscript painters of the 1500s. He was the son of the miniaturist Alexander Bening. His long career in Bruges, where he worked from 1508 until 1555, was distinguished by a series of major commissions for celebrated families. This illuminated leaf, one of 11 preserved from the now lost parent manuscript, was painted for a member of the important Spanish family of Enriquez de Ribera, whose coat of arms appears at the bottom of the miniature. The incident, shown in the upper register, during which Jesus gives a piece of bread to Judas (dressed in yellow and green) to indicate his knowledge of his betrayal, is depicted primarily according to the Gospel of John (13:21–30). In the lower register, Judas, realizing that his betrayal is understood, gets up suddenly to leave. His wooden stool topples over, and Christ’s words appear in a banderole: Quod facis fac cito (""What thou doest, do quickly,"" John 13:27). The two scenes are surrounded by an illusionistic border in liquid silver, with liquid gold acanthus, butterflies, and flowers. In the upper left of the border is the evangelist Matthew.",Type of artwork: Manuscript

Manuscripts produced by this circle of artists are renowned for the decoration of their borders, which typically feature a rich variety of realistically-painted flowers, birds, and butterflies.
This prayer book, called a book of hours, was intended not for a cleric, but for the private devotions of a lay person-in this case, Isabella the Catholic, Queen of Spain (1451-1504).

Manuscripts produced by this circle of artists are renowned for the decoration of their borders, which typically feature a rich variety of realistically-painted flowers, birds, and butterflies.
