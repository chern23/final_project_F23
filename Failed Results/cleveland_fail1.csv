Vase of Flowers,"France, late 19th-early 20th Century","DescriptionKnown for his dark, velvety charcoal drawings and lithographs, Redon began working predominantly in oil and pastel after 1900, thus enlisting color in his explorations of the world of dreams and the imagination. Like other Symbolists, Redon searched for alternative experiences beyond the rational logic of Naturalism and Impressionism. He used his knowledge of botany as a starting point for this painting, but infused the flowers with heightened luminosity and sensuous form.",Type of artwork: Painting
Flowers in a Glass,Netherlands,"DescriptionOne of the first artists to specialize in flower painting, Ambrosius Bosschaert may have been inspired by the botanical gardens and scientific collections in his hometown of Middelburg. The flowers in this bouquet might be common today, but in the 1600s they were costly rarities. Bosschaert captured their fragile beauty with luminous colors and exquisite detail.",Type of artwork: Painting
Spring Flowers,"France, 19th century","DescriptionThis early work reveal's Monet's fascination with capturing the transitory effects that became the primary focus of his later innovations. Painted with almost scientific accuracy, this still life has a freshness and immediacy derived partly from its composition. Isolated against a dark background, the fully mature peonies, potted hydrangeas, and basketed lilacs spill downward and outward from the geraniums at the rear. At the same time, Monet's energetic brushwork conveys the sparkling play of light on leaves and petals.",Type of artwork: Painting
Flower Study of a Lily of the Valley,"Russia, St. Petersburg","DescriptionThis flower study resembles a stem of lily-of-the-valley. Fabergé’s inspiration for his flower studies is said to have come from the floral brooches of precious stones that were made in the 1700s for Catherine the Great as well as from the Japanese art of flower arranging, known as ikebana. Small and delicate, Fabergé’s flower studies were given as intimate gifts to friends by the tsarina and others in the court. She also liked to take them around to wherever the imperial family was residing as a reminder of spring during the harsh Russian winters.",Type of artwork: Miscellaneous
Vase of Flowers,"France, 20th century","DescriptionInspired by Cleveland’s groundbreaking acquisitions of Odilon Redon’s artworks during the 1920s, local philanthropist and collector Leonard C. Hanna Jr. purchased this luminous pastel of a floral still life in 1937. Hanna acquired it from Jacques Seligmann, a dealer based in New York City and Paris who was fundamental in bringing 19th-century French art to American audiences. In 1939, Hanna loaned the pastel to the New York World’s Fair, where it represented Redon’s work. Those who saw it there were attracted to the vivid color and timeless subject, which preoccupied the artist at the end of his life.",Type of artwork: Drawing
Ink Flowers,"China, Yuan dynasty","DescriptionZhao Zhong's flowers, each paired with a poem, echo the fine-style colored flowers of the academic tradition, but instead he used only ink. Fine lines define the contours of each plant, as well as the veins within each petal and leaf. Careful ink washes give subtle modeling to the forms. The combination of lily, narcissus, and peony is unusual as the three belong to no known seasonal or symbolic system popular in the fourteenth century. Zhao’s medical training may have influenced the selection. Powdered lilies, for example, were prescribed to dispel grief, while the bark of tree peony roots was used as a treatment for various blood disorders.",Type of artwork: Painting
White Flower,"America, 20th century","DescriptionO’Keeffe is best known for close-up flower subjects whose magnified forms fill the entire space of each canvas. Likely inspired by similar compositions in modern photography, these images are not only celebrations of natural forms, but also striking essays in abstract design. Although many critics interpreted O’Keeffe’s flower paintings as reflections of femininity in general and female sexuality in particular, the artist strongly opposed such readings. Throughout most of her career, she frequently attempted to persuade others to discuss her work without referring to her gender, writing on one occasion, “I have always been very annoyed at being referred to as a ‘woman artist’ rather than an ‘artist.’”",Type of artwork: Painting
Flower Study of an Anemone,"Russia, St. Petersburg","DescriptionThis flower study depicts a wild anemone in bloom.

Here, in a painting made at a Rajasthani court, the entire bouquet grows magically out of the ground from a single stem.",Type of artwork: Painting
Vase with flower arrangement and scrollwork,,"DescriptionThe symmetry of the floral arrangement emerging from the blue-and-white porcelain vase reveals an idealized vision. The overflowing vase is among the most ancient motifs in Indian art, used to convey the concept of abundance. This image, made for an elite patron of northern India, implies the prosperity that has accrued from international connections. The vase, painted with a European-style landscape, is of the type that was made in China for export to Europe. The scrolling ornament on either side may be ultimately derived from Persian motifs, but reworked into a European style, painted by Indian artists.",Type of artwork: Painting
Canopy with Dragon among Flowers,,"DescriptionThe tapestry sewn into the center of this canopy depicts dragons among flowers, a classic design in Chinese art. Its weavers paid attention to fine details, such as the color gradation of the dragon’s scales, or subtle color changes in the flower petals and leaves. The selection of colored silk threads is soft in tone but rich in variety. All these stylistic characteristics indicate that this tapestry was woven in an imperial Southern Song workshop in the capital of Hangzhou, a center of textile production in the Jiangnan region.",Type of artwork: Textile
Royal Woman Holding a Flower,,"DescriptionFollowing the model of formal imperial Mughal court portraiture, the artist has lavished care on shading the face of a royal woman and the distinctive qualities of her luxurious textiles. Details have been exquisitely rendered, including the fringe of her pink shawl with its lotus vine border and the sprigs of flowers tucked in her hair.",Type of artwork: Painting
Square Jar with Birds and Flowers,,"DescriptionThis lidded square jar was likely paired with a complementary yet nonidentical mate.

"Flowers of Four Seasons, with Poems","China, Ming dynasty","DescriptionIn this painting, flowers are loosely arranged by the seasons: narcissus and peony represent early spring; yellow loquat and lotus, summer; chrysanthemum, autumn; and the plum and evergreen bamboo, winter. The artist added to each flower a poetic line of calligraphy associating each plant with a historic or legendary figure. For example, the chrysanthemum, along with the line “The untrammeled joy at the eastern fence,” refers to the poet Tao Yuanming (died AD 427) who enjoyed chrysanthemums at the eastern fence in his garden. The scroll illustrates Wang Guxiang’s mastery of free brushwork, combining light monochrome ink with transparent colors. In his inscription, Wang says he used the “boneless” style without outlines as developed during the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). Wang was a native of Changzhou, a city in southeast China known for its rich flora and fauna, and flower-and-bird painting tradition.",Type of artwork: Painting

Such images formed an important statement about national identity at a time of constant change.",Type of artwork: Print
A Woman Putting Flowers in Her Hair,"Italy, 18th century","DescriptionScholars generally agree that Rosalba Carriera (1675-1757) developed the art of painting miniatures on ivory, in place of the traditional support of vellum, a fine animal skin. Although she became famous as a pastel painter, in her early career, Carriera decorated ivory snuff boxes-containers used to hold powdered tobacco taken by sniffing up the nostrils-for tourists. This miniature likely served as a lid to a snuff box, due to its elliptical shape in contrast to the oval or occasionally round shapes of most other miniatures. Although painters of ivory snuff boxes used watercolor, the same media artists used on vellum, the finished images on ivory were crude in comparison to those painted on vellum because ivory presents a greasy, non-absorbent surface, causing watercolor to run. Carriera revolutionized the art of watercolor painting on ivory through a process she termed her fondelli, or foundation. She developed a way in which to work in watercolor on ivory that emulated the soft powdery sophistication of her pastels. She used opaque gouache, essentially watercolor paint mixed with a gummy white, a combination of media which adhered to the oily surface of ivory. News of Carriera's innovation spread through Europe, and in the first few decades of the 1700s, most miniaturists abandoned vellum in favor of ivory.",Type of artwork: Portrait Miniature
Gilded Dish with Flowers and Leaves,,"DescriptionThis floral design highlights the rich red, the most difficult to achieve in ceramics, that was developed by Turkish potters. The design is divided with a central swaying saz leaf, with red roses, blue hyacinths, and other floral elements enhanced with glittering gold, a feature that rarely survives. The rim displays a simplified “rock and wave” design adopted from Chinese ceramics which were abundant in the imperial Topkapi Palace in Istanbul",Type of artwork: Ceramic

Child Carrying Fruit and Flowers,"France, 18th century","DescriptionFrench sculptor Claude Michel, called Clodion, frequently depicts children in his sculpture, in this case a convincing toddler, from her pout to her plump toes. The piece is constructed in terracotta, a common medium for Clodion. After firing, the unglazed color of the clay can vary widely; each of Clodion's statues has a slightly different hue. The figure has sustained a number of damages, but has recently been cleaned and repaired.",Type of artwork: Sculpture
Flowers in a Vase,Netherlands,"DescriptionWith just a few flowers, Verelst created a composition of great sophistication and balance. A simple glass flask is filled with a large rose, a red anemone, and a white narcissus tinged with pink. These flowers are surrounded by a scattering of smaller blossoms. Like many still-life painters, Verelst depicted a window reflected in the glass vase, but here he did not show the window's precise structure. He did, however, use another common device: the depiction of a few chips in the stone surface to make the material seem more tangible. Early in his career, Verelst moved from Holland to London, where he worked for the court of King James II and was extravagantly praised for the realism of his flower paintings.",Type of artwork: Painting
Covent Garden Flower Women,"England, 19th century","DescriptionThomson’s collaborator, reporter Adolphe Smith said that “The familiar sight of a poor woman holding a pale child in her arms and offering modest violets to the pedestrian, is pregnant with a poetry which rags, and dirt fail to obliterate.” The jobs, which were passed down between generations, required worked long hours and yielded a meager income.",Type of artwork: Photograph
"The Marsh Flower, a Sad Human Head","France, 19th century","DescriptionThis series is one of many that Odilon Redon created throughout his career. Nearly two-thirds of his lithographs took the form of portfolios—prints connected conceptually by a theme or narrative and physically by a folder or binding. Such works were often dispersed over time, but Cleveland was fortunate to acquire several complete sets with their original covers during the 1920s. Dating from Redon’s early experimentation with lithography, Homage to Goya was intended as a tribute to 18th-century Spanish master Francisco de Goya, whose interest in dreams and the subconscious influenced Redon. The six seemingly unrelated images celebrate Goya’s ambiguity and collectively suggest the introspection and isolation of artistic practice.",Type of artwork: Print
Flower Stand (Jardinière),"France, early 19th Century","DescriptionThomire was the most productive and famous bronze caster in Paris around 1800. The border of this flower stand was cast from the same molds used for a centerpiece signed by Thomire; therefore, the stand can safely be presumed to have been produced by Thomire as well.",Type of artwork: Furniture and woodwork
Flowers and Trees of the Four Seasons,"Japan, Edo period","DescriptionThe painter Watanabe Shikō had a special interest in scientific realism, based on interactions with his patron Konoe Iehiro.

Flower-shaped Mirror,,"DescriptionFrom ancient times, a mirror assumed various roles; a ritualistic tool, a diplomatic gift, and a luxury commodity. During the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392), which saw the great advancement of metallurgy, the royal court was the center of distributing sophisticated bronze artifacts. According to historical records, on the 7th day of the Lunar New Year, the king bestowed a bronze mirror inscribed with auspicious symbols upon each court official as part of a ceremony to celebrate the Day of Humans. This explains why a large quantity of bronze mirrors were excavated from elite tombs.",Type of artwork: Metalwork
Plate with Bird and Flower,,"DescriptionThis dish is a sophisticated example of later ceramists reinterpreting earlier styles of Japanese porcelain. The colors and patterns used look similar to some works produced on the island of Kyushu in the1600s and 1700s. However, the idea to combine alternating blocks of yellow, green, purple, and blue with a ""Chinese grasses"" (karakusa) pattern around the rim of the dish is one hit upon in the early 1900s by an artist familiar with the colors and patterns of earlier works.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
Flower Vase with Chrysanthemums,"Japan, Meiji period","DescriptionSeifū Yohei III (1851–1914) was a son of the Maruyama school painter Okada Ryōhei (dates unknown). Though he studied painting, he ultimately succeeded his ceramics mentor, Seifū Yohei II (1845–1878), in Kyoto. He distinguished himself as a remarkable porcelain artist, taking Qing dynasty Chinese wares as his inspiration. He experimented widely with new glazing techniques. In 1893, he became the first ceramicist to be appointed as an Imperial Household Artist under a system introduced by the Japanese government in 1890. He produced many works for use in Chinese-style tea gatherings called sencha.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
Flowers and Vegetables,"America, 19th century","DescriptionThis lithograph served as an advertisement for the seeds sold at James Vick in Rochester, New York, a leading American nursery center in the latter half of the 19th century. An auxiliary business, the production of fruit and flower prints aided nurserymen and their travelling salesmen. At first the lithographs were hand colored, but in 1871 a local company began to print in color. Lithographs are made by drawing a design onto a stone with a greasy crayon; water adheres to the bare stone while the printing ink sticks to the greasy areas. The process was invented at the end of the 18th century and was often used after about 1820 because it is a speedy and inexpensive medium, producing more impressions compared to other tonal techniques such as mezzotint, aquatint, and stipple.",Type of artwork: Print
Container for Flowers,"Japan, Shōwa period","DescriptionThis flattened hexagonal flower vase showcases the brilliant coloration that can be achieved through wood firing: scorching produced the flash of orange on the surface.

Seated Male Carrying Maize,,"DescriptionThis figure probably represents an Aztec deity-either Macuilxochitl or Xochipilli-whose domain was beauty, the arts, and such pleasures as gameplaying, dancing, and sex. Both names include the Aztec word for ""flower,"" and in one hand the figure holds a cone of flowers, perhaps the blossoming crown of a cactus. For the Aztecs, flowers signified beauty, refinement, and fertility in general and sexuality in particular. The burden of maize cobs on his back also may allude to his creative energies.",Type of artwork: Sculpture
Peppi's Flowers,"America, 20th century","DescriptionCalled Peppi as a child, Joanne Segal Brandford created this ethereal work, influenced by such historic textiles as knotless netted bags of South America and European needle laces. In her words, ""as I became aware of the variety and strength of traditional netting throughout the world, I felt encouraged to continue and expand my own explorations. . . . Recently I have explored ideas of openess/closedness and of spatial ambiguity. Illusion, especially the question of shadow and substance (real/not real), has been of particular interest.""

Insects and Flowers,,"DescriptionMore than 26 feet long, this scroll presents insects, reptiles, and plants in delicate brushwork and pale colors, referring in style to earlier Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279) bird-and-flower paintings. Upon closer inspection, ants dismember a butterfly and reptiles wait to ambush their prey.An inscription at the end of the painting gives us an idea of its meaning: Attributed to the Qing dynasty scholar Zhang Xigeng (張錫庚, 1801–1861), the inscriber relates the work to an earlier painting by Qian Xuan (錢選, c. 1235–before 1307) and further suggests that the painting may allude to the relentlessness of natural selection. By drawing a parallel to tumultuous episodes in Chinese history, the writer might even hint at the domestic rebellions and the aggression of Western powers against China in his lifetime, particularly the Opium Wars (1839–60).",Type of artwork: Painting
Flower Vase with Phoenix in Paulownia,"Japan, Meiji period","DescriptionOne of Seifū Yohei III’s most visually impactful techniques, seen in this work, was to combine complex low-relief designs in clay surrounded by diffused underglaze blue or pink, which he then covered with a transparent or translucent glaze. Yohei III also experimented with clay bodies ranging from bluish white to ivory combined with translucent cream-colored glazes. The atmospheric effects he achieved were considered remarkable.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
A Young Woman Buying a Pink from a Young Man,"Italy, Venice, 18th century","DescriptionGiovanni Battista Piazzetta was celebrated for his finished drawings of saints, portraits, and teste di carattere (character heads). Cleveland’s sheet belongs to the latter genre, which describes portraits embellished with props to suggest a character type or types. Here, Piazzetta united three independent studies of individuals into a single scene, in which a young woman appears to purchase a pink—a type of flower related to the carnation—from a boy with a second young woman looking on.The image bristles with tantalizing narrative potential, but it is left to the viewer to interpret the scene as they wish. Drawings of this size and quality of finish were displayed on walls like paintings, rather than stored in portfolios, with the unfortunate consequence that the Venetian blue paper often faded to a grayish-tan as here. However, the virtuosity of Piazzetta’s technique endures on this sheet. His method of modeling—wetting and rubbing his black crayon rather than hatching—produces the density of tone and velvety shadow. Textural details are supplied by white chalk, evoking the silky weave of the boy’s shirt and the hard substance of the figures’ fingernails. Piazzetta's drawings were in high demand among affluent foreign visitors and helped to supplement his income.",Type of artwork: Drawing
Under Ekvatorn (Beneath the Equator),"Sweden, Stockholm, Svenskt Tenn, 20th century","DescriptionThough this pattern is titled Under Ekvatorn or Beneath the Equator, the design and textile were both produced in Sweden.

Birds and Flowers in a Landscape of the Four Seasons,"Japan, Muromachi period","DescriptionThe monk-painter Sesshp is revered today, as he was in his own time. While he left Kyoto's sophisticated intel-lectual and cultural environment to live in a provincial village in a far western province, he seems never to have severed contacts with the monastic communities of his young adulthood. His residence in Yamaguchi proved fortuitous because his patron, the region's military lord, enjoyed considerable freedom in conducting trade missions overseas with Korea and China. Sesshp went to China in 1467 and traveled about the country, visiting well-known historical sites and Chan (Zen) temples before returning two years later. Thus he became familiar with contemporary painting practices, materials, formats, and subject matter. His assimilation and then transmission of these elements had a profound impact on the following generations of ink painters, patrons, and Zen communities throughout Japan. Despite the presence on these byøbu of the name ""Sesshp,"" they are from the hand of another accom-plished but as yet anonymous follower active in the middle of the sixteenth century. Sesshp's name here, as on a handful of similar bird-and-flower byøbu, attests to the master's identification at that time with the colorful mural paintings on the same theme emanating from Ming dynasty China. This genre had heretofore been relegated to hanging scroll compositions, so the intro-duction into temple and daimyo residences of such an attractive theme surely caused considerable excitement in the later fifteenth century, when in all likelihood Sesshp introduced it into the Japanese painting reper-toire. Subsequently, artists of varying backgrounds and training tried their hands at these large, dramatic scenes. From right to left the composition portrays an array of flowering plants in the near distance that indicate the passage of the seasons. Birds, usually paired, occupy this setting, engaged in various activities that lend naturalism and an air of peacefulness. The world they inhabit may be characterized pictorially by expansive middle-ground waterscapes that end where the far distant mountains rise as backdrops. These features appear consistently in other bird-and-flower byøbu attributed to Sesshp. Also noteworthy is the absence of any birds of prey such as the samurai's beloved hawks, emblems of fierceness and graceful strength that appear often in the byøbu of sixteenth-century Kano and Soga school painters.",Type of artwork: Painting

The world they inhabit may be characterized pictorially by expansive middle-ground waterscapes that end where the far distant mountains rise as backdrops. These features appear consistently in other bird-and-flower byøbu attributed to Sesshp. Also noteworthy is the absence of any birds of prey such as the samurai's beloved hawks, emblems of fierceness and graceful strength that appear often in the byøbu of sixteenth-century Kano and Soga school painters.",Type of artwork: Painting
Sandy and Her Husband,America,"DescriptionIn Sandy and Her Husband, the dancing couple at the center of the image is joined by Amos herself: the artist inserted herself into the picture by rendering an earlier self-portrait, Flower Sniffer (1966), which hangs on the wall behind the couple. However, even as Amos is part of the composition, she is peripheral to the scene, unseen or ignored by the dancers. From the early 1960s until her death in 2020, Amos made paintings, prints, and textiles celebrating African American identity and culture, and often exploring women’s presence within that heritage.",Type of artwork: Painting
Woolen carpet with millefleurs decoration,,"DescriptionPashmina, a very fine fiber made from the fleece of Himalayan goats, was a material highly valued at the Mughal courts. Luxury rugs functioned in several ways, including as insulators for palatial and ceremonial spaces and as framing devices for important figures. In a biography of the Mughal emperor Akbar (reigned 1556–1605), called the Ain-i-Akbari, the court historian Abu’l Fazl (1551–1602) poetically wrote that such textiles created “a beautiful flowerbed.” The description is apt, as this carpet features an impressively symmetrical floral design known as millefleurs, or “thousand flowers” in French. Viewing several of these carpets and other hangings at once would have been visually impressive for court attendees.",Type of artwork: Carpet
Vase with Bird and Flower Design,,"DescriptionThis vase with broad shoulders and a tall neck represents a typical style of 19th-century blue-and-white porcelain. Unlike earlier examples decorated mainly with literati themes that evoke neo-Confucian moral values—plum blossoms (purity), orchids (grace), bamboo (integrity), and chrysanthemums (loftiness)—porcelain works of the 1800s feature fully bloomed peonies and a pair of playful birds, symbols of wealth and familial harmony.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
Summer Flowers,"Japan, Edo period","DescriptionWhite hydrangea, orange-colored demon’s lantern, and greenbrier vine appear together in this scroll. The artist used the dripping-in (tarashikomi) technique to create a sense of depth and dimension in the leaves of the plants. A carefully controlled brush loaded with a high ratio of water to ink or color is key to the success of this brush method. Gold lines indicate the veins of leaves and the seams of pods.",Type of artwork: Painting
Self Portrait,"France, School of Lyon, 19th century","DescriptionFrançois LePage belonged to a family of flower painters and worked in the French city of Lyon, which was famous for producing silk, particularly fabric with flower motifs. Flower painting was a specialty associated with the Lyon school of painting, and is a subject that requires both delicacy and dexterity, both of which are highlighted in this small self-portrait.",Type of artwork: Painting
Stater: Three-Petal Flower (obverse); Horse and wheels (reverse),,"DescriptionThe Iceni were a native tribe inhabiting Norfolk, Suffolk, and parts of Cambridgeshire. They were described by the Romans as powerful, unbroken by war. In AD 61 the king of the Iceni, Prasutagus, died, leaving his apparently considerable wealth to his two daughters and to the Roman Emperor, as joint heirs. However, while the Roman legions under Aulus Plautius were in Wales taking drastic steps to exterminate Druidism, Boadicea, the widow of Prasutagus, was ill-treated by the Romans and her two daughters were outraged. The Iceni rose in revolt and helped by their neighbors the Trinovantes, they overran the Roman settlements. It is said that 70,000 Romans were massacred at Camulodunum, and the Iceni, with Boadicea in a war chariot at their head, sacked and burned Verulamium (St. Albans, Hertfordshire), and London. Suetonius, one of the leading Roman generals, returned from the west with all possible speed and came up with the Iceni in the northwest of Roman London. Here a great battle was fought, resulting in a complete victory for the disciplined Roman forces; thousands of Britons were killed. The site of this battle is supposed to have been near what is now Kings Cross, in central London, commemorated by Battle Bridge Road.",Type of artwork: Coins

"Makaras, Phoenixes and Flowers",,"DescriptionCentral Asian designers drew from a wide variety of motifs, both imaginary and real. In this silk, rows of soaring phoenixes alternate with rows of makaras. Combining a fish body and tail, wings, and a dragon's head, the makara originated in India as a water creature. With the spread of Buddhism, the motif migrated into the art of Central Asia and, from there, into the art of northern China. In Italy, exotic Central Asian patterns such as this inspired flights of imagination. One such example (seen in the photograph below) shows a creature, strikingly similar to the makara, spewing forth a dragon while a dog walks up its back.",Type of artwork: Textile
Flower-shaped Mirror,,"DescriptionFrom ancient times, a mirror assumed various roles; a ritualistic tool, a diplomatic gift, and a luxury commodity. During the Goryeo dynasty (918-1392), which saw the great advancement of metallurgy, the royal court was the center of distributing sophisticated bronze artifacts. According to historical records, on the 7th day of the Lunar New Year, the king bestowed a bronze mirror inscribed with auspicious symbols upon each court official as part of a ceremony to celebrate the Day of Humans.

Velvet panel with four youths smelling flowers,,"DescriptionA new style depicting single figures with limited modeling and European artistic influence was spearheaded by the Iranian painter Riza ‘Abbasi and adopted by textile designers in sumptuous brocaded velvets. Even with faded colors, this grand length retains ten colors of velvet pile, a feat that Iranian velvet weavers achieved by skillfully replacing colored pile warp during weaving, and thereby creating the most colorful velvets in the world. Elegant youths dominate the simplified outdoor setting here with diminutive cypresses and silver ponds on a ground originally covered with gold thread. Fashionably dressed young men wear wide-brimmed hats, silver robes, stole-like scarves, and knotted sashes that are symbols of status and rank.",Type of artwork: Velvet

"Christ Gathering Roses, Centerpiece of an Altar Cloth(?)",,"DescriptionThe altar cloth was probably made for a southern German convent in the 15th century.

Birds and Flowers,"Japan, Muromachi period","DescriptionThese two paintings are possibly by Sesshū Tōyō. They once flanked a central scroll with an ink landscape. The unbalanced nature of the compositions, however, suggests they may be images recycled from larger paintings. The one with sweet osmanthus and hibiscus is an autumn scene, the other is a summer scene with daylilies and gardenias. Folding screens often contrast two seasons or depict all four across a single pair of screens. Sesshū’s works were sufficiently prized that repurposing them in fragmentary form to display in an alcove of a luxurious room would not be an unusual choice.",Type of artwork: Painting
Flowers and Rocks,,"DescriptionHere, the painter uses delicate brushwork and vivid colors to depict an early summer scene of three kinds of flowers growing beside a garden rock: From top to bottom we see flowering pomegranate, then peonies, and lilies below. Like the peony, which conveys wishes for wealth and prosperity, the pomegranate flower, here in festive red color turning soon into fruit with many seeds, is associated with the wish for many sons. The lily, in Chinese ""baihe,"" is a homophone with the pun ""togetherness for a hundred years,"" expressing wishes for harmony and unity. The scroll would have made a suitable gift to married women.",Type of artwork: Painting

Brocade with Lotus Flowers,,"DescriptionThe tradition of brocade weaving in northern China continued after the Mongol conquest. However, the arrival of eastern Iranian craftsmen affected both the design and the structure of the brocades: patterns became symmetrical and paired warps replaced single warps. Both of these modifications can be observed in this example. At the same time, however, the Jin tradition of floating foundation wefts across the back sides of the brocaded areas continued. Brocades such as this may have been woven in Hongzhou (in Hebei province), where weavers from both western Asia and from the former Jin capital, Bianjing, are known to have worked together.",Type of artwork: Textile

Morning Glory with Black,"America, 20th century","DescriptionO'Keeffe is best known for close-up flower subjects whose magnified forms fill the entire space of each canvas. Likely inspired by similar compositions in modern photography, these images are not only celebrations of nature, but also striking essays in abstract design. Although many critics interpreted O'Keeffe's flower paintings as reflections of femininity in general and female sexuality in particular, the artist strongly opposed such readings. Throughout most of her career, she frequently attempted to persuade others to discuss her work without referring to her gender, writing on one occasion, ""I have always been very annoyed at being referred to as a 'woman artist' rather than an 'artist.'""",Type of artwork: Painting
"Page from the Late Shah Jahan Album: Persian Calligraphy framed by an ornamental border of flowers, birds, and deer","Mughal India, court of Shah Jahan","DescriptionAbout 100 years after the calligraphy was completed by a Persian master and embellished with gold and floral arabesques, the small page was mounted into an album for the Mughal emperor of India. Mughal artists filled the outer border with floral vines, blooming and budding with many varieties. Pairs of birds perch throughout; male and female deer relax, listening to the birdsong. The Indian artists chose to emphasize nature’s abundance and life-giving forces, whereas the Persian artists sought to achieve exquisite, gemlike refinement.The central poem, by Ibn-i Yamin (Persian, 1286–1368), encourages the reader not to worry about unexpected calamities.",Type of artwork: Painting

Flowers in Blue and Black Striped Vase,"America, 20th century","DescriptionBaumann loved flowers and made many drawings (exemplified by House and Garden and Hollyhock Garden in this gallery) and several color woodcuts of gardens. He also painted vases of flowers in front of decorative octagonal or oval backgrounds, some of which he then executed as prints. Although, Flowers in Blue and Black Striped Vase was never translated into a color woodcut. Sunny Messengers, with a similar format, was made in 1915.   Sunny Messengers was included in the first exhibition of contemporary American woodblock prints. Organized by Baumann, the show opened at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1916. Color woodcuts were growing in popularity; Baumann’s prints won a gold medal at the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915.",Type of artwork: Drawing

Jar with Bird and Flower Decoration,,"DescriptionJoseon blue-and-white porcelains were called “靑畫,"" meaning “painted in blue.” The blue here indicates cobalt pigment. In the 1700s, the royal court banned the importation of cobalt blue for its luxurious nature; thus, relatively few Joseon blue-and-white porcelain vessels were produced at that time.

Two huge yellow bolsters set rakishly on the bed suggest restlessness inside the chamber.

Fluted Cup with Dragon Handle,,"DescriptionVery thinly potted, the subtly lobed body of this cup is almost translucent. The thin, slightly opaque, light greenish glaze lends a sugary shine. Applied elements, including the handle, beaded borders, and sculptural floret, are constructed and glazed with the same materials as the body, providing a seamless blend of form and decorative embellishment. The result is an evocative reminder of slightly earlier silver cups, also created in the form of flowers. This pristine, natural construction is challenged, however, by the archaic dragon that acts as the handle. Borrowed from the decoration found on much earlier bronzes, this added form illustrates the eclecticism of the Yuan, the attempt to blend present vision with interest in the past.",Type of artwork: Ceramic

Las Meninas,America,"DescriptionLas Meninas draws on traditions throughout global art and culture to address issues surrounding the female body, race, beauty, and community. The work’s skirted form conjures figures from the Spanish Golden Age painting Las Meninas (1656) by Diego Velazquez, apparel worn in the Afro-Brazilian religious tradition candomblé, and Mousgoum buildings in Cameroon. The white-glazed terracotta torso, alluding to sacred and secular traditions of body painting, leads to a faceless head, incorporating both figuration and abstraction.",Type of artwork: Sculpture
In Blue,"America, 20th century","DescriptionIn his work, Jim Hodges reveals qualities of beauty and grace in the most unassuming materials. Through relatively simple acts of manipulation and reappraisal, he invests the man-made with a previously absent level of emotion and authenticity. In Blue is a diaphanous curtain of lush, tropical colors that is both imposing for its monumental scale and delicate in its fragility. Activated by the slightest breeze, its artificial elements ripple with the movement of natural life forms. To create In Blue, Hodges took apart hundreds of silk flowers, flattened and ironed each element, pinned the pieces together, and then carefully hand-sewed them into a scrim.",Type of artwork: Textile
Bowl with Birds and Flowers,,"DescriptionThis porcelain bowl is considered to have been made in the ""Transitional period,"" a term used to define the period between about 1620 and 1683 when official kilns in Jingdezhen were no longer under imperial supervision due to the transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasties.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
"Child Standing on a Chair Holding Flowers, with Mother",,"DescriptionUntil the mid-1850s the daguerreotype process was the method preferred by the commercial photographers willing to meet the ever-growing demand for likenesses of family and friends. This daguerreotype captures the patience of a mother and child, who were required to hold their poses for some time during the exposure of the silver-coated copper plate. Only the bouquet of flowers held by the child is slightly blurred. Characteristic of the technique, the details in the image—fabric, facial features, and accessories—are clearly defined.",Type of artwork: Photograph
"Jar with Flowers, Rocks and Pheasants",,"DescriptionIn the Qing dynasty, art reached a high standard of technical perfection despite a tendency for extravagance and exaggerated ornament. This jar with susancai (plain three-color) decoration uses shades of light green, purple, and yellow, but no red. The vase features a pair of pheasants looking at each other among flowering plants, such as peonies and magnolia.

handmade paper, commonly used for book covers and
endpapers, to add texture to the broad areas of flat color and
to emphasize the rough, handcrafted quality of his prints.
The unsophisticated, folk-like images allude to early Japanese
Buddhist prints, in which black lines, rich color contrasts,
and simple naïve forms are paramount. Being a Christian,
Watanabe often chose religious themes from the Bible.",Type of artwork: Print
Flowering Crab Apple,"China, Ming dynasty","DescriptionShen Zhou painted a broken branch (zhezhi 折枝) of crab apple, a fragment of nature rather than the full plant in its natural context. Shen uses calligraphic outlines in pure ink to depict the flower petals. The swift yet precise brushstrokes together with the slight S-shaped branch convey vitality. The inscription is a poem written by the artist, commenting on the lovely color and melancholic aura of the crab apple blossom. Shen Zhou is the founder of the Wu School, a group of scholars and officials active around Suzhou in eastern China, known for practicing painting and calligraphy in a refined and elegant style.",Type of artwork: Painting
Tulips,France,"DescriptionHenri Matisse, leader of the French Fauves (“Wild Beasts”), advocated the complete liberation of color from natural appearances and reducing formal elements to absolute essentials. “What I dream of,” he wrote, “is an art of balance, purity, and serenity.” In Tulips a vase of flowers floats mysteriously against fields of thinly applied turquoise, aqua, and lavender. While the colorful tulips express a joyful sentiment, the vase rests precariously on a planar shape, perhaps a tabletop. The uncertainty of the vase’s position as it extends over the edge, and whether the tabletop continues to the right through a plane of transparent color, together with the strange black rectangle in the background, inserts a contravening feeling of disquiet and visual tension into the time-honored genre of still-life painting.",Type of artwork: Painting

Plate from Dessert Service: Nettle Leaved Bell Flower,"England, Derby, 18th century","DescriptionEach dish is decorated with recognizable plants, the names of which are inscribed on the base in both Latin and English. Identifying the blossoms only became customary in the late 18th century when a single piece of porcelain was decorated with one species, and flowers were represented along with leaves, stems, seed pods, and roots. All of this reflects Carolus Linnaeus’s recent invention of a scientific method to categorize all known flora. The decorations on the Derby factory’s products derive from contemporary English botanical publications. For instance, illustrations in William Curtis’s The Botanical Magazine served as models for the French marigold and nettle-leaved bell flower on the dessert service.",Type of artwork: Ceramic

Nō Costume (Nuihaku) with  Blossoming Trees and Flowers,,"DescriptionThis magnificent robe was a costume specifically designed for performances of Noh theater in Japan. Originating during the 1300s from simple folk plays, Noh drama evolved into formal presentations of ritual, theater, dance, and music performed in the courts and shrines of the nobility. Stories were derived from a variety of sources—myths, legends, poetry, and prose—many dating back to the medieval period. Because great importance was placed on subtlety and elegance, plots tended to be minimal. Whether male or female all roles were played by men. Central to these performances were the masks and costumes worn by the actors. The brilliance and elegance of this robe are characteristic of costumes made solely for Noh theater. Its date in the first half of the 1700s is indicated by the proportions of the robe, the choice of embroidery stitches (satin, couching, and outline), and the absence of decoration at the hips, a fashion also reflected in kimonos at that time. The design of weeping cherry trees and irises in the snow was very likely inspired by a medieval Japanese poem. Robes decorated with embroidery against a gold ground were reserved for female roles. These robes were worn under the external garment and were only partially visible.",Type of artwork: Garment

Following a severe head wound and hospitalization, he returned to painting in 1916, but worked alone developing a personal Cubist style concerned with complex spatial constructions, color relationships, and textured surfaces.

"Collection of Flowers and Fruits Painted after Nature:  Bouquet of Foxglove, Clematis, Pansy, Peony, Poppy, and Yellow Day Lily","France, late 18th-early 19th Century","DescriptionBy the mid-17th century, there was a surge of interest in beautiful, exotic plants and formal royal gardens. At Fountainebleau and the Louvre, the gardens were filled with flowers from far-away places, such as the Near East, India, the East and West Indies, and South America. In 1735 Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) invented the first scientific classification system for 7,700 plants. As a result, accuracy as well as artistic skill were required for the numerous portfolios of botanical prints popular with gardeners and those involved with the decorative arts. In these lavish productions, some of the color is printed but the remainder is added with watercolor, giving the illusion of transparency, luminosity, and the delicacy characteristic of flowers. Stipple was a technique developed in England from the 1760s. A point is used to build up a mass of flicks and dots to create a wide range of tones.",Type of artwork: Print

"Hatsuito of the Yamashiroya Likened to Bush Clover, from Beauties of the Floating World Compared to Flowers","Japan, Edo period","DescriptionCourtesan Hatsuito of a brothel named Yamashiroya is likened to autumnal bush clover in this series comparing the qualities of courtesans to flowers. Hatsuito ties her servant’s obi sash while a gibbon emerges from a painting in the room’s viewing alcove to offer a love letter on which Hatsuito’s name appears. Gibbons reaching in vain for the moon’s reflection in water is a common metaphor for the deluded mind, and bush clover in moonlight is a popular seasonal motif. Here, the ideas are combined as the gibbon woos this unattainable beauty.",Type of artwork: Print
Bodhidharma Crossing the Yangzi on a Reed,,"DescriptionChan Buddhism was introduced to China in the early 500s by the Indian monk Bodhidharma, or Puti Damo (died before 534). Upon his arrival in China, Bodhidharma was allegedly granted an audience with the Liang dynasty emperor Wu (reigned 502–49). Realizing the emperor did not understand his mission, the monk left Nanjing, crossed the Yangzi on a reed, and settled north in Henan province’s Shaolin monastery. Here, Bodhidharma is sketched in few pale brushstrokes. The diluted and swift lines on an empty ground emphasize the Chan idea that all things are illusionary. The inscription reads: Wind rises from the reed flowers, the waves are high; It’s a long way to go beyond the cliff of the Shaoshi mountain; Above the worlds of kalpas a flower is opening into five petals; So that your barefoot heels are just fine for the whipping rattans. —translated by Wai-Kam Ho",Type of artwork: Painting

Flowering Bush above an Eroded Bank,"Italy, 16th century","DescriptionFederico Barocci, who worked in Urbino, made landscape sketches for use in his paintings and as independent studies. The artist’s multimedia approach—combining chalks, ink washes, and opaque paints—was novel at the time but would become standard practice for landscape artists working in later centuries.

Portrait of a Woman with Flowers,"America, 20th century","DescriptionFor more than 50 years, James VanDerZee produced images that embody the spirit of Harlem. From the 1920s to the 1940s, he was the neighborhood's most popular and prolific photographer, his camera capturing everyone from ordinary citizens to celebrities. In the studio VanDerZee photographed glamorously dressed young people and dignified men and women. On location, he chronicled picnics, parades, families, church congregations, and the dead in their coffins. These four prints, from a collection of 33 recently acquired by the museum, show VanDerZee's skill at posing and lighting his subjects. His artistic sensibilities are reflected in elaborate backdrops and the use of accessories that reinforced his sitters' associations with culture and wealth. The artist worked with a variety of techniques, including multiple negatives and hand coloring, to make artful photographs that set him apart from his more traditional, less aesthetically inclined competitors. Just as he often signed his name and date directly onto the negative, he would also selectively draw on it-to smooth a complexion and touch up imperfections, or to add extra jewelry or smoke drifting from a cigarette-whatever was necessary to emphasize the grace and dignity of his client, regardless of race, age, or social status.",Type of artwork: Photograph

Pitcher,,"DescriptionThe chrysanthemum is the flower of autumn. In East Asia, its wine was believed to bring longevity if drunk during the Double Nine Festival (September 9). ""Drinking Wine,"" a poem by Tao Yuanming (365–427), combines the flower with the theme of the reclusive life: ""From the eastern fence, I pluck chrysanthemum flowers, and idly look toward the southern hills."" In Korea, the chrysanthemum was established as a popular motif for Goryeo inlaid celadon as early as the 1100s. The flower was used as the main motif for wine service vessels in particular. When Koreans drank wine from Goryeo celadon decorated with chrysanthemum designs, they believed that Tao’s faithful spirit transferred to their inner mind, as did the blessings of longevity.",Type of artwork: Ceramic

He had joined the anti-Manchu resistance, was briefly imprisoned, and witnessed the death of family members in 1644. Like other artists, Yun Shouping expressed his Ming loyalism in coded pictures. The peony, king of flowers, and a spring garden motif developed new meaning during the Qing dynasty. The inscription indicates that Yun turns the flower into a motif representing the glorious past. The herbaceous peonies here appear somewhat withered and pale, with faint reddish veins running through its broken branches, perhaps a coded message. The inscription reads, An old painting by an anonymous painter of the Northern Song Dynasty has five varieties of flowers painted in the boneless manner.

Icon of the Virgin and Child,,"DescriptionThis tapestry glorifying the Virgin Mary is among the rarest objects in the museum’s collection. In a composition borrowed from imperial Byzantine art, Mary is shown seated on a jeweled throne with the Christ child and flanked by archangels Michael and Gabriel. Above, Christ appears in a radiant light supported by two angels. Portraits of the apostles, identified in Greek, appear in the surrounding wreath symbolizing eternal life. This portable sacred textile was presumably displayed at the front of a public or private place of worship. This unique tapestry is one of the earliest Christian icons to survive. Woven icons were among the miraculous works shown to pilgrims in Jerusalem according to Abbot Adomnan of Iona (about 624–704) who described a linen cloth ""said to have been woven by Saint Mary, and is for this reason preserved in a church and venerated by the whole population. Pictures of the twelve apostles are woven into it, and there is also a portrait of the Lord."" The abbot’s description of the woven icon suggests it must have been similar to the tapestry displayed here. The delicate effects of shading in the facial features, garments, and vegetation were achieved by weaving the panel sideways with at least 20 colors, just as medieval tapestry weavers did centuries later in Europe. The high cost of dyes caused this majestic icon to be far costlier than painted images.",Type of artwork: Textile

Figure of a Gardener,"England, London, Bow","DescriptionEven though this figure and her counterpart (1945.37) are not accompanied by a sheep, these ceramic sculptures were sometimes known as “Garland Shepherds” during the mid-1700s. The name derived from a similar set produced by one of the Bow Porcelain Factory’s rivals, the Derby Porcelain Factory, in which the male figure holds a lamb. While these two factories often produced similar sets of pastoral, allegorical, biographical, and religious figures, the Bow Factory was known as one of the preeminent porcelain manufacturers, rivaled only by the Chelsea Porcelain Factory, with which Bow would later merge.",Type of artwork: Ceramic

It was commissioned by the Duke of Liang, Fang Xuanling (578–648), for the blessing of his second son and daughter-in-law, the Tang imperial princess of Gaoyang.

Lozenge Shaped Dish from Dessert Service: Large Flowered St. John's Wort,"England, Derby, 18th century","DescriptionEach dish is decorated with recognizable plants, the names of which are inscribed on the base in both Latin and English. Identifying the blossoms only became customary in the late 18th century when a single piece of porcelain was decorated with one species, and flowers were represented along with leaves, stems, seed pods, and roots. All of this reflects Carolus Linnaeus’s recent invention of a scientific method to categorize all known flora. The decorations on the Derby factory’s products derive from contemporary English botanical publications. For instance, illustrations in William Curtis’s The Botanical Magazine served as models for the French marigold and nettle-leaved bell flower on the dessert service.",Type of artwork: Ceramic

Amaryllis,"America, 20th century","DescriptionStill-life was one of Charles Demuth's favorite genres, and he created works on this theme throughout his career. This drawing of a blooming amaryllis was completed while the artist was convalescing with diabetes in his hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Because of his physical weakness, he was limited to working in watercolor, a less demanding medium than painting, and to subjects that he could easily observe, such as flowers.

Hand Mirror,France,"DescriptionWe often think of art as the work of just one person. In the case of this mirror, its harmonious appearance conceals the number of people involved in its creation. The designer Félix Bracquemond was commissioned by wealthy banker Baron Joseph Vitta to create decorative objects for his multiple homes. Bracquemond worked with other artists in making this mirror: well-known sculptor Auguste Rodin created the figure of Venus; artisan Alexandre Riquet fashioned the elaborate enameled decoration; and goldsmiths from Parisian jewelers Falize Frères completed the mirror and its blue translucent frame embedded with yellow, pink, and white flowers. Through close collaboration between patron, designer, and artists, this mirror represents the trend at the end of the 1800s for blending artistic specialties to create a single work of art. The CMA’s collection includes Bracquemond’s preparatory drawings for the mirror and Rodin’s carved plaster model for the figure of Venus.",Type of artwork: Miscellaneous

Portrait of the Marquise d'Aguirandes,"France, 18th century","DescriptionLike many French portraitists active during the ancien régime, François-Hubert Drouais was skilled at veiling the physical imperfections of his subjects. This portrait certainly has this quality: the face has been idealized, smoothed, and perfected, but the focus of the painting is less on the Marquise and more on her elegant gown, which is a particularly fine rendering of eighteenth-century printed cloth, with the brilliant gold and white fabric strewn with meticulously detailed flowers and lace.",Type of artwork: Painting

The only adornment of his figure is the auspicious symbol on his chest and the wheels of righteousness on his palms. The stark form of thenude body standing in a posture of meditation is masterfully set off from the array of gods and serpent divinities who venerate him. He stands with his feet on a lotus pedestal, but his hierarchically tall form reaches to the heavens, where gods fly to honor him with flower garlands.

Costumed Dancers Performing in a Garden Tavern,"France, 18th century","DescriptionGabriel de Saint-Aubin was known for his rapidly executed, sketchy style, often used to depict performances and social scenes. The exaggerated lifted legs of the dancers seen here imply a comic, theatrical style; no social dance during the 18th century would have permitted such pronounced gestures, especially for a woman. Both dancers wear jackets with irregular hemlines decorated with round bells similar to those found on jesters’ costumes. The lanterns and swags of flowers strung from trees and the small orchestra playing on the right suggest a guinguette, or outdoor tavern with a pleasure garden.",Type of artwork: Drawing

Yellow Chrysanthemums and Red Osmanthus in the Style of Wang Yuan,"China, Ming dynasty","DescriptionShen Zhou, a native from Suzhou, was descended from a prominent land-owning family with strong ties to literati culture. Because Shen Zhou never entered government service, he had ample opportunity to cultivate the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy.Chrysanthemums and red osmanthus both bloom in autumn. The deep orange osmanthus flowers emanate a characteristically sweet fragrance. According to his inscription on the painting, Shen Zhou sought to imitate the style of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) painter Wang Yuan. His color-filled brushstrokes and washes, however, anticipate the flower painting style of Yun Shouping, whose Peonies are also in the Cleveland Museum of Art collection, https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1967.192.

Julius Caesar,"Italy, Florence, 15th century","DescriptionRenowned Roman general and statesman Julius Caesar (100–44 BCE) appears here as a political rather than military leader, worn by the burdens of office, with carefully described signs of aging. Mino probably used ancient coins from the collection of the Medici, Florence's ruling family, as his starting point for this sculpture. However, the complex carving, the clinging drapery, and the psychological intensity all characterize the inventiveness Renaissance artists brought to classical subject matter. In this case, Caesar offered an important model for leadership, masculinity, and composure. The garland is clearly by a different hand, but passages, such as the ribbons and flowers in low relief, correspond to details found in other decorative carvings from Mino's workshop. Initially, the limestone setting was probably put into a wall, perhaps in a lunette over the door, from which it was later removed. However, the relationship between the garland and the relief has not yet been clarified and is the subject of ongoing research.",Type of artwork: Sculpture
Pair of Potpourri Vases with Covers,,"DescriptionThese vases were likely made by the celebrated Parisian ceramics firm of Edmé Samson (1810-91). To cater to the resurgence in taste for 18th-century designs, the Samson firm specialized in making reproductions of rare 18th-century European porcelains, especially those from firms that had already copied Chinese porcelains. In this case, these vases are designs taken from models produced by the St. Cloud factory in the 1750s after earlier Qing dynasty Chinese ceramics. However, the telltale sign that these vases are made by Samson and not St. Cloud is that the originals would have been made from a soft-paste porcelain (fired at a lower temperature), while these examples are made of hard-paste porcelain (fired at the highest temperature).",Type of artwork: Ceramic

Wedding Gown,,"DescriptionThis wedding gown is exquisitely embroidered with various symbols of happiness in colorful silk threads. Butterflies stand for marital happiness; the phoenix, numerous offspring; and lotus flowers and white cranes, longevity. Yet, the bridal gown does not attest to the life of luxury. To the contrary, many traces of repairs, trimmings, and patchwork, reflect Joseon-period women’s commitment to value neo-Confucian aesthetics of frugality and modesty. Substantial repairs and patching reveal that this gown served as an important communal resource to be shared and passed down through several generations. Only its collar and sleeves, which are made of thick paper, are replaced with new ones, while the robe was reused for decades.",Type of artwork: Garment

Covent Garden Labourers,"England, 19th century","DescriptionCovent Garden workers, whose day started before 5 a.m., were divided into job-workers or odd-men—who were paid for each parcel they delivered and thus received little income in the off-seasons—and a much smaller group of salaried workers who were paid year-round to create arrangements and stock and help run the stalls.",Type of artwork: Photograph

Plum Blossoms and Peonies,"China, Qing dynasty","DescriptionOne of the so-called Yangzhou Eccentrics (a group of painters who lived in Yangzhou and were known for their unorthodox art and lifestyle), Gao Fenghan depicts China’s two most loved flowers in full bloom—the “cold beauty,” or plum blossom, in the first section, and the “king of flowers,” or peony, in the second section. Painted in 1741, the year when Gao decided to leave the south and return home to Shandong province in eastern China, this work was likely a token of farewell. His casual brushwork may indicate his mental and physical struggle at the time. After having crippled his right hand in 1737, Gao used his left hand to paint and achieved a crudeness and eccentric style unattainable before.",Type of artwork: Painting
Large Bowl with Molded Decoration,,"DescriptionThe lobed sides of this bowl open like a flower and rise to a solidly molded and pointed rim reminiscent of metalware. The bowl with a thick, shiny, jadelike green glaze was made by potters who mastered techniques to fire vessels of enormous sizes for the export market. Large bowls and plates were primarily shipped to the Middle East where they were used for banquets, in which food was traditionally offered in the center of a seated gathering.",Type of artwork: Ceramic
Illuminated Folio from a Gulistan (Rose Garden) of Sa'di (c. 1213–1291),Iran,"DescriptionThe border scene is set in a magical forest bursting with blossoms. At the top, a winged lion chases a winged deer, who is caught in the bottom border. The imagery of a lion biting down on its prey dates from the Achaemenid period in Iran (550–330 BCE) and references the valor of the king. A fox scurries off to the right.

"Rainbow Love Mountain Ranch, New Mexico","America, 21st century","DescriptionThis print exemplifies Polly Apfelbaum’s interest in bright, saturated colors and repeated patterns. The artist finds inspiration in popular culture, using simple forms that draw from a wide range of sources—here, typographical characters called dingbats. The work’s title refers to a road sign that Apfelbaum repeatedly passed while she was working at the Tamarind Institute, a lithographic print shop in New Mexico. There, she used a rainbow roll—an ink roller with multiple blended colors—to produce the print’s vivid tonality.",Type of artwork: Print
Locket,,"DescriptionThis locket may have once been an amulet containing prayers and talismans or a container for perfume or other cosmetic items. At the center, a young woman stands between two groupings of large red flowers. The connections between women and nature have ancient precedents in India, often communicating auspicious fertility.

Merging Emerging,"America, Ohio, 21st century","DescriptionAfter decades of working primarily in a figurative mode, Skuodas turned to pure abstraction only recently. Her art often addresses connections between the spiritual and physical realms; in her words, ""I believe our psyches are linked to the laws which manifest themselves in the formation of a flower, a snowflake, or a seashell.""Befitting its title, the painting's composition is structured, yet openended along its perimeter.",Type of artwork: Painting
Thiaroye 1944,"South Africa, 21st century","DescriptionThese men represent Senegalese Tirailleurs, West African soldiers serving in the French army. Those who had been prisoners of war in World War II learned that they would receive no back pay and smaller pensions than white prisoners of war. They protested at Thiaroye; some were killed and many imprisoned. That revolt sparked a nationalist movement in Senegal that eventually liberated the country from French colonial rule.",Type of artwork: Photograph

In this Persian retelling of the Old Testament account from the Bible, Zulaykha lusted after Joseph, even though she was already married to Potiphar. Joseph, with the golden halo, resisted her advances until she became a widow and retained his youth, because of his extreme virtue. Above, Zulaykha as a young woman waits for Joseph in her house where murals of them as a happy couple are painted on the walls.",Type of artwork: Painting

Royal Female Donor,,"DescriptionCarrying a lamp in one hand, this female figure draped in finery was probably included as the donor of a sculptural group. She wears a complex headdress consisting of a network of beads and plaques joined together, ending in a bell at her forehead and crowning a long cloth that reaches to her waist.

The Sunflower Arch,"America, 20th century","DescriptionAt the time he made this drawing, Burchfield had begun to develop a personal symbolic language, which he called “Conventions for Abstract Thoughts.” Using simple forms, such as the arched shape of the flowers seen here, he aimed to communicate universal emotions—in this case, “Mute Sorrow.” Burchfield saw a connection between this mood and sunflowers, which were among his favorite subjects. He often depicted them anthropomorphically, suggesting either open eyes or, as here, slumped human forms—as he described, “giv[ing] a sense of pre-autumnal melancholy in early September.”",Type of artwork: Drawing

Bed cover with floral medallion pattern,,"DescriptionIn the center, a blue and gold bird grasps the curling stem of a trilobed flower. Bright colors and dizzying patterns radiate from this medallion, creating a delicate garden set against a soft white ground. In changing light, the gilt- and silver-wrapped threads animate the entire textile.Techniques for creating metal-wrapped threads were introduced to Indian workshops in the early 1700s by Portuguese merchants, who frequently traded in Indian textiles. However, embroidery techniques have been in use on the subcontinent since ancient times, as evidenced by the discovery of bronze needles and the representation of textiles in sculpture and paintings.",Type of artwork: Embroidery
Bouquet,"France, 17th century","DescriptionSeventeenth-century botanical illustrators were stimulated by a surge of interest in their subject. While in the mid-16th century only 500 plants were known, less than a century later that number had grown to 6,000. A passion for cultivating beautiful rather than useful plants took hold, and formal gardens with carefully arranged flower beds based on embroidery designs supplemented varieties of local plants with foreign samples. Exotic flowers became available in Europe as the Dutch founded colonies in the East and West Indies, South America, and India. While fabulous royal gardens were planted in France at Fontainebleau and the Louvre, for instance, in England “a whole nation went mad about flowers.”",Type of artwork: Print
"Portrait of a kneeling holy man, from the Prince Salim Album","Mughal India, court of Akbar","DescriptionOne of the few surviving works that appear to have been made by an artist brought from Iran by Akbar’s father, Humayun, shortly after his arrival in Mughal India, this page was mounted into the Prince Salim Album in his breakaway court in Allahabad. The flowing lyrical contour lines, penetrating expression, and soft yet wiry texture of the beard reveal the hand of a master. The verse written above and below the painting is a quotation from a poetic sermon of the Persian author Sana’i, who lived about 1100: If it were greed that led you to acquire learning, then be afraid, For at night, a thief with a torch can take away the choicest goods! The calligraphy suggests that the kneeling figure is a charlatan holy man who wears the blue robe of a Sufi mystic and acts with humility and piety for monetary gain rather than sincerity of devotion.",Type of artwork: Painting

Roundel with Mermaids and Lotus,,"DescriptionThis ivory disk was possibly part of a massive earring around which lobes were stretched so that they rest on the shoulders. Eight figures that are half woman and half fish hold hands in a ring around a series of concentric circles containing floral imagery. Their hands and tails make the repeated form of an auspicious trident-shaped symbol, often depicted with fish tails in combination with a lotus flower. The full-breasted forms, the tails, and the lotus flowers evoke the imagery of life-giving waters. A circle of eight female figures later comes to refer to the maidens of the eight directions of the sky (ashtadikpalikas).",Type of artwork: Ivory
