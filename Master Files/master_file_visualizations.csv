Manuscripts produced by this circle of artists are renowned for the decoration of their borders, which typically feature a rich variety of realistically-painted flowers, birds, and butterflies. This prayer book, called a book of hours, was intended not for a cleric, but for the private devotions of a lay person-in this case, Isabella the Catholic, Queen of Spain (1451-1504). Isabella's coat of arms embellishes the book's frontispiece. It is unlikely that the book was commissioned by the Queen herself; rather, she probably received it as a diplomatic gift from someone courting her patronage, perhaps Cardinal Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros. A Franciscan friar, Jimenez was dependent upon Isabella for his advancement, first to the post of Queen's confessor in 1492, and then to Archbishop of Toledo in 1495.",282

Manuscripts produced by this circle of artists are renowned for the decoration of their borders, which typically feature a rich variety of realistically-painted flowers, birds, and butterflies.
This prayer book, called a book of hours, was intended not for a cleric, but for the private devotions of a lay person-in this case, Isabella the Catholic, Queen of Spain (1451-1504). Isabella's coat of arms embellishes the book's frontispiece. It is unlikely that the book was commissioned by the Queen herself; rather, she probably received it as a diplomatic gift from someone courting her patronage, perhaps Cardinal Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros. A Franciscan friar, Jimenez was dependent upon Isabella for his advancement, first to the post of Queen's confessor in 1492, and then to Archbishop of Toledo in 1495.",282

Poem on Plum,18th - 19th Century,Korea,35.907757,127.766922,East Asia and Pacific,Calligraphy,"For Yi Hwang, a celebrated scholar and poet in 16th-century Korea, writing poems was an escape from partisan politics. Because its flowers often bloom in the middle of winter, Joseon period Korean scholars like Yi found plum blossoms a perfect subject to express the value of endurance and self-cultivation. In his numerous poems, Yi used plum blossom imagery to express his feelings. The poem on this hanging scroll reads: “Wishing to fly away, red leaves left the mountain villa. Their large sleeves are frosted due to blue clouds. The clouds in the sky look upright, which are beyond human beings’ ability. The plum tree whispered to me that [the leaves] fell from the wind and landed on the fence.” The mountain villa in this poem may refer to the Dosan Academy, a Confucian school that Yi established after his retirement, and the red leaves of the plum blossom are probably Yi’s poetic personification.",54

Woolen carpet with millefleurs decoration,17th Century,Null,,,Null,Carpet,"Pashmina, a very fine fiber made from the fleece of Himalayan goats, was a material highly valued at the Mughal courts. Luxury rugs functioned in several ways, including as insulators for palatial and ceremonial spaces and as framing devices for important figures. In a biography of the Mughal emperor Akbar (reigned 1556–1605), called the Ain-i-Akbari, the court historian Abu’l Fazl (1551–1602) poetically wrote that such textiles created “a beautiful flowerbed.” The description is apt, as this carpet features an impressively symmetrical floral design known as millefleurs, or “thousand flowers” in French. Viewing several of these carpets and other hangings at once would have been visually impressive for court attendees.",

Plate from Dessert Service: Nettle Leaved Bell Flower,19th Century,England,53.4084,2.9916,Europe and Central Asia,Ceramics,"Each dish is decorated with recognizable plants, the names of which are inscribed on the base in both Latin and English. Identifying the blossoms only became customary in the late 18th century when a single piece of porcelain was decorated with one species, and flowers were represented along with leaves, stems, seed pods, and roots. All of this reflects Carolus Linnaeus’s recent invention of a scientific method to categorize all known flora. The decorations on the Derby factory’s products derive from contemporary English botanical publications. For instance, illustrations in William Curtis’s The Botanical Magazine served as models for the French marigold and nettle-leaved bell flower on the dessert service.",405

Figure of a Gardener,18th Century,England,53.4084,2.9916,Europe and Central Asia,Ceramics,"Even though this figure and her counterpart (1945.37) are not accompanied by a sheep, these ceramic sculptures were sometimes known as “Garland Shepherds” during the mid-1700s. The name derived from a similar set produced by one of the Bow Porcelain Factory’s rivals, the Derby Porcelain Factory, in which the male figure holds a lamb. While these two factories often produced similar sets of pastoral, allegorical, biographical, and religious figures, the Bow Factory was known as one of the preeminent porcelain manufacturers, rivaled only by the Chelsea Porcelain Factory, with which Bow would later merge.",405

Plate with Bird and Flower,20th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"This dish is a sophisticated example of later ceramists reinterpreting earlier styles of Japanese porcelain. The colors and patterns used look similar to some works produced on the island of Kyushu in the1600s and 1700s. However, the idea to combine alternating blocks of yellow, green, purple, and blue with a ""Chinese grasses"" (karakusa) pattern around the rim of the dish is one hit upon in the early 1900s by an artist familiar with the colors and patterns of earlier works.",
Vase with Bird and Flower Design,19th - 20th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"This vase with broad shoulders and a tall neck represents a typical style of 19th-century blue-and-white porcelain. Unlike earlier examples decorated mainly with literati themes that evoke neo-Confucian moral values—plum blossoms (purity), orchids (grace), bamboo (integrity), and chrysanthemums (loftiness)—porcelain works of the 1800s feature fully bloomed peonies and a pair of playful birds, symbols of wealth and familial harmony.",
Pair of Hexagonal Flower Pots,14th - 15th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"This deep hexagonal flowerpot, one of a pair in the collection, is numbered ""8"" and bears additional inscriptions to indicate specifically the location of its usage within the palace: ""for use in the Study of Illumination (Mingchuang yong)"" within the ""Hall of Cultivating the Mind (Yangxin Dian)"" of the Forbidden City. The inscriptions seem to suggest the Qing imperial provenance of this pair.",
Bowl with Flower Petals,14th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"Yuan dynasty Shufu ware was a further development of the earlier qingbai ware and is characterized by a more heavily constructed body, opaque white glaze, molded decoration, and at times the inscription Shufu that gives the ware its name. Although lacking the inscription here, this bowl possesses the characteristics and decoration of Shufu pieces.",
Jar with Bird and Flower Decoration,18th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"Joseon blue-and-white porcelains were called “靑畫,"" meaning “painted in blue.” The blue here indicates cobalt pigment. In the 1700s, the royal court banned the importation of cobalt blue for its luxurious nature; thus, relatively few Joseon blue-and-white porcelain vessels were produced at that time. In that context, this modest-looking jar was considered to be a rare luxury.",
Plate with Bird and Flower,17th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,,
Hollyhock-shaped Cup,15th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"This very rare porcelain cup is called a hollyhock cup because its rim resembles a hollyhock blossom. This type of cup was produced only in the state-owned kiln for a limited time from the late 1400s to mid-1500s. Like sunflowers, hollyhocks also open their blooms toward the sun, signifying loyalty to the king. According to Korean royal archives, hollyhock cups were used during state banquets when the king offered wine to court officials. Also, a hollyhock-shaped cup was used in tea ceremonies to welcome visiting Chinese diplomats. In comparison to ceramic works of the late Joseon period that favor natural and rustic sensibilities seen in this gallery, this hollyhock cup illustrates the precision and perfection that were core aesthetic values of early Joseon period art.",
Large Dish with Artichokes,16th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"Ceramic vessels and tiles produced in Iznik, Turkey, for the Ottoman court in Istanbul represented the finest Islamic ceramics. Floral and vegetal motifs are a hallmark of Iznik pottery. The center of this dish is covered in a dynamic artichoke motif interwoven with rosettes and serrated saz leaves. The artichoke design was likely inspired by luxury Italian textiles imported into the Ottoman court. The dish represents a high point of Ottoman art during the reign of Sultan Suleyman the Magnificent (1520–66) in which European, Persian, Chinese, and Egyptian influences contributed to a distinct artistic language.",
Fluted Cup with Dragon Handle,14th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"Very thinly potted, the subtly lobed body of this cup is almost translucent. The thin, slightly opaque, light greenish glaze lends a sugary shine. Applied elements, including the handle, beaded borders, and sculptural floret, are constructed and glazed with the same materials as the body, providing a seamless blend of form and decorative embellishment. The result is an evocative reminder of slightly earlier silver cups, also created in the form of flowers. This pristine, natural construction is challenged, however, by the archaic dragon that acts as the handle. Borrowed from the decoration found on much earlier bronzes, this added form illustrates the eclecticism of the Yuan, the attempt to blend present vision with interest in the past.",
Bowl with Lotus Petal Design in Relief,13th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"As early as the seventh century, the practice of drinking tea and wine became an important part of elite leisure culture in Korea.

Vase with Golden Pheasants,18th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"The flower-and-bird painting in this vase was intricately executed in colored enamels (falangcai), with careful modeling, shading, and blending of colors reflecting European influences through missionary-artists at the Qing court. The Jesuit artist Giuseppe Castiglione (1688–1766), in particular, exerted tremendous impact at the Qianlong academy.",
Pitcher,12th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"The chrysanthemum is the flower of autumn. In East Asia, its wine was believed to bring longevity if drunk during the Double Nine Festival (September 9). ""Drinking Wine,"" a poem by Tao Yuanming (365–427), combines the flower with the theme of the reclusive life: ""From the eastern fence, I pluck chrysanthemum flowers, and idly look toward the southern hills."" In Korea, the chrysanthemum was established as a popular motif for Goryeo inlaid celadon as early as the 1100s. The flower was used as the main motif for wine service vessels in particular. When Koreans drank wine from Goryeo celadon decorated with chrysanthemum designs, they believed that Tao’s faithful spirit transferred to their inner mind, as did the blessings of longevity.",
Square Jar with Birds and Flowers,17th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"This lidded square jar was likely paired with a complementary yet nonidentical mate.

Gilded Dish with Flowers and Leaves,16th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"This floral design highlights the rich red, the most difficult to achieve in ceramics, that was developed by Turkish potters. The design is divided with a central swaying saz leaf, with red roses, blue hyacinths, and other floral elements enhanced with glittering gold, a feature that rarely survives. The rim displays a simplified “rock and wave” design adopted from Chinese ceramics which were abundant in the imperial Topkapi Palace in Istanbul",
Bowl with Flowering Vines Design in Relief,12th - 13th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"As early as the seventh century, the practice of drinking tea and wine became an important part of elite leisure culture in Korea. A wide bowl like this example was especially suitable for drinking powdered tea shaved from a compressed tea cake, the most commonly enjoyed type during the Goryeo period.

Large Bowl with Molded Decoration,14th - 15th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"The lobed sides of this bowl open like a flower and rise to a solidly molded and pointed rim reminiscent of metalware. The bowl with a thick, shiny, jadelike green glaze was made by potters who mastered techniques to fire vessels of enormous sizes for the export market.

"Bowl with Poppies, Tree Peony, and Flowering Mimosa",18th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"Developments in enamel technology led to new possibilities in polychrome decoration. Pinks appeared, lending their name to the new palette of overglaze colors (famille rose), and the addition of opaque white allowed painters to vary the value of pigments, enhancing the painterly quality of porcelain decoration. As on painted scrolls and album leaves, the image is accompanied with a poem, in this case: ""Branches come alive in the moonlight; Blossoms fill the autumn realms.""",
Bowl with Carved Lotus Design,12th - 14 Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"This pale green–glazed bowl is decorated with a medallion at the center and a lotus motif on the inside and outside walls.

"Jar with Flowers, Rocks and Pheasants",17th - 18th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"In the Qing dynasty, art reached a high standard of technical perfection despite a tendency for extravagance and exaggerated ornament. This jar with susancai (plain three-color) decoration uses shades of light green, purple, and yellow, but no red. The vase features a pair of pheasants looking at each other among flowering plants, such as peonies and magnolia. The porcelain painter used fine dark outlines in a more graphic style to delineate motifs, to texture rocks, and depict minute details such as holes in weathered leaves of plants.",
Water Container with Birds and Flowers,17th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"The shape of this small vessel suggests it may be a fresh-water container included among the tools used in Japan for preparing steeped tea, introduced to Japan by Chan (Zen) monks from southern China in the mid-1600s.",

Most of them, like this example, have survived in Japan. The vase’s glaze is of exceptional color and consistency. By the Yuan dynasty, Longquan potters mastered techniques to fire vases, jars, and plates of enormous sizes and in great quantities. Some 300 kilns were active in the Longquan area, in Zhejiang province, to supply the domestic and export markets, such as Japan, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and North Africa. Celadons reached Europe as early as the 1400s.",

Covered Jar with Carved Lotus Petals,4th - 6th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"This jar still has its original cover, which is rare among surviving examples. Its missing knob most likely had the shape of a lotus bud. Beautifully carved lotus petals cover the vessel’s shoulder and lid under a translucent green glaze. In Buddhism, the lotus is a flower symbolizing purity and detachment from worldly affairs; its presence suggests that this vessel was meant to be used in a religious context. The well-crafted double loop handles may have held a silk cloth or other textile that would have been folded over the lid to keep it in place. This aesthetic prefigures the celebrated green celadons in adjacent regions.",
Female Figure of a Court Entertainer Dancing,2nd Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"During the Han era, tombs of the elite were provided with sculpted renditions of their earthly entourage, such as guardians or musicians, to signify their status in the afterlife.

Each of the flattened sides is decorated with an image of a lotus flower pond, enclosed in a lobed panel. The protruding sides, on the other hand, depict an image of bamboo trees and plum blossoms. This particular example seems to have been produced in the late 14th century, when the overall quality of techniques involved in making celadon works sharply deteriorated. In contrast to translucent greenish blue celadon works of the 12th century, this flask has gray greenish glaze due to less refined clay. Furthermore, its rather roughly executed inlaid design shows a clear sign of decline in craftsmanship.

Here, broad silver bands around the bowls’ rims accentuate their precious appearance. The incised petals are inspired by lotus flowers and the domed covers by their circular leaves. The lotus motif often indicates the use of an object in a Buddhist context, in which it is a symbol of purity as its flowers emerge unsullied from the mud of lakes and ponds.

Bowl,18th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"Flowers in vivid colors including peonies, lilies, and chrysanthemums are set against a brilliant red enamel ground.

Bottle-shaped Vase,18th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"This spectacular vase, one of a pair in the collection, depicts flowering and fruiting peach trees to convey an auspicious message of affluence and long life. Developments in enamel technology led to new possibilities in polychrome decoration of Qing imperial porcelains. Pinks appeared, lending their name to the new palette of overglaze colors (famille rose), and the addition of opaque white allowed painters to vary the value of pigments, enhancing the painterly quality of porcelain decoration.",
Large Jar with Peonies and Chrysanthemums,17th Century,Null,,,Null,Ceramics,"Japan took China’s place as Europe’s main source for export porcelain around the middle of the 17th century because the transition from the Ming to the Qing dynasty in China disrupted trade. The Dutch East India Company began to buy Japanese porcelain in 1650 and exported approximately 50,000 Japanese porcelains in 1659. Such large jars demonstrate how artists took the birds and flowers motifs found in paintings and applied them to the blue and white porcelain called sometsuke. The Japanese transformed typical Chinese Jingdezhen blue and white porcelain into a spacious composition. This design shows the changing of the seasons. One side depicts a peony blossom in the spring, and the other side continues with chrysanthemums and an orchid in the autumn.",

Stater: Three-Petal Flower (obverse); Horse and wheels (reverse),1st Century BCE - 1st Century CE,Null,,,Null,Coins,"The Iceni were a native tribe inhabiting Norfolk, Suffolk, and parts of Cambridgeshire. They were described by the Romans as powerful, unbroken by war. In AD 61 the king of the Iceni, Prasutagus, died, leaving his apparently considerable wealth to his two daughters and to the Roman Emperor, as joint heirs. However, while the Roman legions under Aulus Plautius were in Wales taking drastic steps to exterminate Druidism, Boadicea, the widow of Prasutagus, was ill-treated by the Romans and her two daughters were outraged. The Iceni rose in revolt and helped by their neighbors the Trinovantes, they overran the Roman settlements. It is said that 70,000 Romans were massacred at Camulodunum, and the Iceni, with Boadicea in a war chariot at their head, sacked and burned Verulamium (St. Albans, Hertfordshire), and London. Suetonius, one of the leading Roman generals, returned from the west with all possible speed and came up with the Iceni in the northwest of Roman London. Here a great battle was fought, resulting in a complete victory for the disciplined Roman forces; thousands of Britons were killed. The site of this battle is supposed to have been near what is now Kings Cross, in central London, commemorated by Battle Bridge Road.",

Utopia,20th Century,Belgium,50.503887,4.469936,Europe and Central Asia,Drawing,"René Magritte was among the leading figures of the Surrealist movement, whose work emphasized dreams, the subconscious, and a break from reason and logic during the early 20th century. Magritte, in particular, often situated realistic imagery within ridiculous or unusual situations in order to question perception. Here, a rose grows on a rocky island amid a vast sea, set against a blue sky filled with large white clouds. By situating the flower within a barren and inhospitable setting, Magritte invites the viewer to question its purpose and survival. Created as World War II came to an end, the enigmatic image could symbolize a new beginning, although Magritte avoided assigning it a specific meaning.",282

In 1939, Hanna loaned the pastel to the New York World’s Fair, where it represented Redon’s work. Those who saw it there were attracted to the vivid color and timeless subject, which preoccupied the artist at the end of his life.",744

Pasture Rose (Rosa Carolina Corymbosa),19th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Drawing,"Born in Belgium, Pierre-Joseph Redouté was trained by his father and began a ten-year career as an itinerant artist at age 13. He joined his brother in Paris working on theater sets and decorations, but his true love was flower painting, such as this drawing. Redouté achieved an international reputation for his botanical illustrations and enjoyed a long, successful career.",744
Violette Heymann,20th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Drawing,"Although he was known early in his career for works primarily in black and white, such as charcoal drawings and lithographs, Odilon Redon turned to more colorful media, including pastel, later on. In particular, he focused on commissioned pastel portraits of women with flowers, such as this one. Here, the young niece of the Parisian collector Marcel Kapferer appears alongside colorful blossoms as she looks forward, focused as if in the dreamlike state evoked by her surroundings.",744

Victoria Dubourg,19th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Drawing,"This drawing is one of several studies that Edgar Degas created for a painted portrait of the artist Victoria Dubourg, now in the collection of the Toledo Museum of Art. Here, Degas concentrated on the facial expression of Dubourg, known for her still-lifes of flowers. Attempting to precisely render Dubourg's direct gaze, Degas drew her eyes in greater detail, even adding an additional sketch along the sheet's upper margin.",744
Costumed Dancers Performing in a Garden Tavern,18th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Drawing,"Gabriel de Saint-Aubin was known for his rapidly executed, sketchy style, often used to depict performances and social scenes. The exaggerated lifted legs of the dancers seen here imply a comic, theatrical style; no social dance during the 18th century would have permitted such pronounced gestures, especially for a woman. Both dancers wear jackets with irregular hemlines decorated with round bells similar to those found on jesters’ costumes. The lanterns and swags of flowers strung from trees and the small orchestra playing on the right suggest a guinguette, or outdoor tavern with a pleasure garden.",744
Landscape Near Paris,19th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Drawing,"In his delicate studies of flowers and fields, like this panoramic view of the distant Paris, Bonvin captured the beauty of nature, observed with an innocent, untrained eye. His untutored responses to nature permitted him to be more experimental than his contemporaries working in watercolor. A realist in his rendering of natural detail, Bonvin simultaneously foreshadowed Impressionism with his interest in light and atmosphere.",744
"Cross Section of the Hôtel de Ville Seen in Perspective Showing the Decoration and Illumination of the Courtyard and Rooms Created on the Occasion of the Ball Given the Night of August 30 and 31, 1739",18th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Drawing,"This cross-section of a building allows a unique view into a French royal wedding. The partiers are dressed in costume and dance in the Parisian town hall. No expense was spared in the lavish celebration, from flowers to drinks to the elaborate false ceiling painted to look like the sky.",744
Portrait of a Woman,19th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Drawing,"Béranger is known as an academic painter of genre subjects. This pastel study of a young woman with downcast eyes conveys a sense of vitality and immediacy lacking in his more highly finished works in oil. While the graceful features of her face are articulated with tender detail, the flowers adorning her hair are summarily indicated with a handful of rapid strokes, and her bodice is barely suggested.",744
An Insect Ball,19th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Drawing,"J.-J. Grandville became best known for fantastical drawings like this one, in which insects act like humans. Here, smaller creatures above use flowers or leaves as musical instruments, and their larger counterparts below dance a galop. An Insect Ball was one of more than 50 drawings that the artist made for wood-engraved reproduction in Le Magasin pittoresque (The Picturesque Store), a popular encyclopedic review edited by Grandville's friend Edouard Charton. In text printed below the wood-engraved version of An Insect Ball, Grandville explained that his aim was to show insects with the same humorous personalities seen at any human ball, while also rendering their forms with scientific accuracy.",744

A Young Woman Buying a Pink from a Young Man,18th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Drawing,"Giovanni Battista Piazzetta was celebrated for his finished drawings of saints, portraits, and teste di carattere (character heads). Cleveland’s sheet belongs to the latter genre, which describes portraits embellished with props to suggest a character type or types. Here, Piazzetta united three independent studies of individuals into a single scene, in which a young woman appears to purchase a pink—a type of flower related to the carnation—from a boy with a second young woman looking on.The image bristles with tantalizing narrative potential, but it is left to the viewer to interpret the scene as they wish. Drawings of this size and quality of finish were displayed on walls like paintings, rather than stored in portfolios, with the unfortunate consequence that the Venetian blue paper often faded to a grayish-tan as here. However, the virtuosity of Piazzetta’s technique endures on this sheet. His method of modeling—wetting and rubbing his black crayon rather than hatching—produces the density of tone and velvety shadow. Textural details are supplied by white chalk, evoking the silky weave of the boy’s shirt and the hard substance of the figures’ fingernails. Piazzetta's drawings were in high demand among affluent foreign visitors and helped to supplement his income.",132
Flowering Bush above an Eroded Bank,16th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Drawing,"Federico Barocci, who worked in Urbino, made landscape sketches for use in his paintings and as independent studies. The artist’s multimedia approach—combining chalks, ink washes, and opaque paints—was novel at the time but would become standard practice for landscape artists working in later centuries. Novel, as well, was his interest in excerpts of the natural world rather than fully realized scenes. Here, the artist drew an eroded bank with a few bold lines in black chalk, then used a brush to layer brown and white ink washes, capturing the untamed clump of earth with remarkable naturalism.",132
"Fish and Flower and Female Buddha (Sakana, Hana to Butsujo)",20th Century,Japan,36.204824,138.252924,East Asia and Pacific,Drawing,"Executed quickly with brush and ink, this sketch captures the artist’s first inspiration. Since Munakata did not slavishly follow his preparatory drawings when he carved the woodblock, they only give a general idea of the final image.",1374

De Poolse Muts,17th Century,Netherlands,52.132633,5.291266,Europe and Central Asia,Drawing,"Still-life painting began in the Northern Netherlands (present-day Holland) around the turn of the 1600s. Still-life painter Balthasar van der Ast made this precise botanical study of a pink carnation as a reference that he could add later to a painting of an elaborate bouquet of flowers. Van der Ast inscribed the name “The Polish Cap,” on the sheet to suggest that the flower came from foreign lands.",72
"Portrait of a Woman near a Fountain, a Rose in Her Hand",17th Century,Netherlands,52.132633,5.291266,Europe and Central Asia,Drawing,"The Dutch artist Johann Thopas made meticulous drawn portraits of merchants and intellectuals in the Dutch city of Assendelft. His drawn portraits—made faster and for less expense than painted portraits—appealed to middle-class patrons, as did his unique style combining naturalistic likenesses with elaborate background settings. Using a combination of leadpoint and ink, Thopas achieved remarkable tonal subtlety in this image of a well-dressed woman holding a flower in front of an ornate neoclassical garden.",72
Dragon in foliage with lion and phoenix heads,16th Century,Turkey,38.963745,35.243322,Europe and Central Asia,Drawing,"A dragon lunges toward a pearl in the form of a seal inscribed with a verse from the Koran: “And I commit my case unto God” (40:44). In his front claw, the dragon grasps two flowering branches that magically produce a variety of blooms, including a lion that bites the dragon’s neck and a phoenix, who competes for the pearl. Sahkulu was trained by Persian artists, as were many artists of Mughal India during the 1500s. He joined the Ottoman imperial painting atelier in Istanbul in 1526 and became the head in 1545.",50

Lilies and Sparrow,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Drawing,"Joseph Stella made nature studies throughout his career. For this simple, spare composition he used metalpoint, a medium associated with the Italian Renaissance and rarely seen in the 20th century. Although metalpoint cannot be erased, its unique qualities -- precision, delicacy, and sharpness -- appealed to Stella and he often combined it with colored pencils to achieve a brightness that resembled oil painting. The careful execution and large size of this sheet suggest that Stella considered it a finished work of art.",1029

In these drawings, he hoped to capture the contrast of a flower that he saw as “gloriously alive . . . at the height of its vigor . . . [which] nevertheless seems more alive . . . when quite dead.”",1029

Flowers in Blue and Black Striped Vase,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Drawing,"Baumann loved flowers and made many drawings (exemplified by House and Garden and Hollyhock Garden in this gallery) and several color woodcuts of gardens. He also painted vases of flowers in front of decorative octagonal or oval backgrounds, some of which he then executed as prints. Although, Flowers in Blue and Black Striped Vase was never translated into a color woodcut. Sunny Messengers, with a similar format, was made in 1915.   Sunny Messengers was included in the first exhibition of contemporary American woodblock prints. Organized by Baumann, the show opened at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1916. Color woodcuts were growing in popularity; Baumann’s prints won a gold medal at the Panama Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco in 1915.",1029

Using natural objects and ephemera that she compiled over a lifetime, Tawney’s collages display the artist’s personal visual vocabulary and poetic response to materials. Recurring images—such as eggs, feathers, birds, baby animals, crosses, and circles—engage with universal themes such as vulnerability, resilience, infinity, and spirituality. Here, below the flower petal on the envelope Tawney wrote ""the iris / its blue blood drained away.""",1029

The Sunflower Arch,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Drawing,"At the time he made this drawing, Burchfield had begun to develop a personal symbolic language, which he called “Conventions for Abstract Thoughts.” Using simple forms, such as the arched shape of the flowers seen here, he aimed to communicate universal emotions—in this case, “Mute Sorrow.” Burchfield saw a connection between this mood and sunflowers, which were among his favorite subjects. He often depicted them anthropomorphically, suggesting either open eyes or, as here, slumped human forms—as he described, “giv[ing] a sense of pre-autumnal melancholy in early September.”",1029

Hollyhock Garden,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Drawing,"Baumann began Hollyhock Garden around 1914 when living in Brown County, Indiana. After settling in Santa Fe, he reworked the scene in about 1919, adding Southwestern touches, such as transforming the wooden Indiana farmhouse with a shingle roof into adobe buildings with tile roofs. He must have referenced Hollyhock Garden in 1927 when making the color woodcut Hoosier Garden, since there are many correspondences between them, including the picket fence with its profusion of yellow and orange flowers and the porch chair, which lurks ghostlike beneath a thin layer of paint in the drawing.",1029

Embroidery with Birds,8th - 9th Century,Null,,,Null,Embroidery,"These engaging little birds are embroidered in a naturalistic style that developed during the 8th and 9th centuries. All but one are oriented away from the central pair that flanks a tulip growing from a hill. Contrasting with the spontaneity of the birds is the structured pattern of the silk ground—rosettes within a lozenge grid. Such contrasts frequently occur among embroideries of the Tang dynasty. Also characteristic of embroideries from that period is the use of discrete areas of color with no attempts at shading. The form of the birds, the hill, and the flower are based on Persian models. The introduction of foreign motifs into the decorative arts of Central Asia and China was one of the most important results of active trading in precious objects along the Silk Road.",

Buddhist Vestment (Kesa),20th Century,Null,,,Null,Garment,Kesa are Buddhist monastic robes that originated in India. The robes are named after the brown or saffron dye originally used in their production. The primary motif on this seven-paneled kesa is a long-tailed bird with a flower in its mouth. This motif was imported from Persia (present-day Iran) through China during the Nara period (710–794)and is interpreted as a positive symbol. The bird delivers happiness in its mouth.,
Nō Costume (Nuihaku) with  Blossoming Trees and Flowers,17th Century,Null,,,Null,Garment,"This magnificent robe was a costume specifically designed for performances of Noh theater in Japan. Originating during the 1300s from simple folk plays, Noh drama evolved into formal presentations of ritual, theater, dance, and music performed in the courts and shrines of the nobility. Stories were derived from a variety of sources—myths, legends, poetry, and prose—many dating back to the medieval period. Because great importance was placed on subtlety and elegance, plots tended to be minimal. Whether male or female all roles were played by men. Central to these performances were the masks and costumes worn by the actors. The brilliance and elegance of this robe are characteristic of costumes made solely for Noh theater. Its date in the first half of the 1700s is indicated by the proportions of the robe, the choice of embroidery stitches (satin, couching, and outline), and the absence of decoration at the hips, a fashion also reflected in kimonos at that time. The design of weeping cherry trees and irises in the snow was very likely inspired by a medieval Japanese poem. Robes decorated with embroidery against a gold ground were reserved for female roles. These robes were worn under the external garment and were only partially visible.",
Buddhist Surplice (Kesa),20th Century,Null,,,Null,Garment,"The kesa is a Buddhist monk’s vestment worn folded and draped over one shoulder, and fastened over the chest. In keeping with the austere conditions of monastic life, kesa were traditionally fashioned from remainders of donated garments sewn together into a series of columns. The wider, central column symbolizes the Buddha. The orange squares with a phoenix and flower pattern in each corner represent the deities who guard the four directions, while the two at the top on either side of the central column symbolize attendant bodhisattvas, or the Nio, guardians who protect the Buddhist Law. This kesa is sewn from a textile with bold roundels with dragon and phoenix motifs.",

Cap,19th Century,Null,,,Null,Garment,"Historically in India, head coverings were worn in outdoor and formal contexts and can signal age, allegiance, and status among Indian men and boys.

The intricate ornamentation in the form of stylized unripe mangoes and flowering plants is the specialty of artisans in Kashmir, where they had access to the fine wool of Himalayan goats. The coats, however, were popular in many regions throughout India.",

For these boots, different outer fabrics were used: a patterned silk for the leg portion, and tapestry (kesi) for the foot. Since both were considered luxury fabrics, they were pieced together from remnants too precious to discard. Consequently, the silk pattern was not used in relation to the form of the boot. By contrast, these boots would have been made for a court official, not a member of the imperial family. The patterned silk was woven with geese flanking a vase of flowers on a stand and surrounded by cloud scrolls. The Chinese motif of flowers arranged in a vase was adopted by the Liao during the 11th century and indicates an 11th- or early 12th-century date for the boots.",

For these boots, different outer fabrics were used: a patterned silk for the leg portion, and tapestry (kesi) for the foot. Since both were considered luxury fabrics, they were pieced together from remnants too precious to discard. Consequently, the silk pattern was not used in relation to the form of the boot, as seen in some other imperial boots. By contrast, these boots would have been made for a court official, not a member of the imperial family. The patterned silk was woven with geese flanking a vase of flowers on a stand and surrounded by cloud scrolls. The Chinese motif of flowers arranged in a vase was adopted by the Liao during the 11th century and indicates an 11th- or early 12th-century date for the boots.",
Prince's trousers and lining,8th Century,Null,,,Null,Garment,"This coat and pants are part of a set of garments that originally included an outer pair of pants and silk boots made from the same material as the coat. The cut of the coat suggests that the set belonged to a little boy. Such rich garments would have been worn by a member of the imperial family or nobility. The fabrics comprising this outfit were woven in widely distant parts of Asia. The silk of the coat, with ducks in pearl roundels, was woven in Sogdiana. The white silk of the pants, ornamented with flowers and birds, is Chinese. Both garments are lined with a Chinese silk woven with a radial floral pattern that was common during the 8th century. The coat and pants were made at a time when Tibetan power extended to parts of China, eastern Central Asia, and the trade routes to Sogdiana.",

Hookah Base,18th Century,Null,,,Null,Glass,"Smoking tobacco was introduced to the Mughal court from Iran in the very early 1600s and soon became popular. This base formed part of a hookah, or water pipe, which consisted of a base that held water—sometimes perfumed with herbs or fresh fruit—a detachable bowl to hold tobacco, and a long tube. Early hookahs used existing vessels for bases, including coconut shells. By the late 1600s or early 1700s, richly decorated pieces like this were produced. The jewel-like decoration of blue and green blossoms evokes a garden in which a smoker might have sat.",

Roundel with Mermaids and Lotus,2nd Century BCE,Null,,,Null,Ivories,"This ivory disk was possibly part of a massive earring around which lobes were stretched so that they rest on the shoulders. Eight figures that are half woman and half fish hold hands in a ring around a series of concentric circles containing floral imagery. Their hands and tails make the repeated form of an auspicious trident-shaped symbol, often depicted with fish tails in combination with a lotus flower. The full-breasted forms, the tails, and the lotus flowers evoke the imagery of life-giving waters. A circle of eight female figures later comes to refer to the maidens of the eight directions of the sky (ashtadikpalikas).",

Cleverly, the enamelist placed a lotus design on the bottom of the vessel; as a flower that floats on water, the bloom represents both the water imaginatively splashing against the underside of the boat and the actual ink swishing inside the bilge. This inkstand was purchased by Cleveland Museum of Art founder Jeptha Homer Wade II (1857–1926) and his wife Ellen Garretson Wade (1857–1917) as they made a tour of India on their own pleasure boat, the Wadena.",

Sculptures such as this were installed in niches in an interior passage of a temple. As is typical of Burmese works, this sculpture was carved from a solid piece of wood. Its surface was covered in black lacquer and then gilded; a great deal of the gilding remains intact. Because lacquer is an easily perishable material, works of this type and size are exceedingly rare; this sculpture is one of the best extant examples.",

Leaf Excised from a Book of Hours: The Nativity,15th Century,Belgium,50.503887,4.469936,Europe and Central Asia,Manuscript,"This book, made by an artist of the Ghent-Bruges school of illumination, represents the culmination of Flemish book painting. Its main features were the use of rich colors, decorative and illusionistic effects, a love of landscape, and a strong sense of visual narrative. Its most distinctive innovation was the development of a new style of border decoration featuring realistic motifs which cast shadows onto colored grounds to create an effect of spaciousness. These motifs included a diverse assortment of flowers, butterflies, insects, birds, and sprays of acanthus foliage.",282
Single Leaf with Scenes from the Last Supper,16th Century,Belgium,50.503887,4.469936,Europe and Central Asia,Manuscript,"Born either in Ghent or Antwerp in 1483, Simon Bening became one of the most famous manuscript painters of the 1500s. He was the son of the miniaturist Alexander Bening. His long career in Bruges, where he worked from 1508 until 1555, was distinguished by a series of major commissions for celebrated families. This illuminated leaf, one of 11 preserved from the now lost parent manuscript, was painted for a member of the important Spanish family of Enriquez de Ribera, whose coat of arms appears at the bottom of the miniature. The incident, shown in the upper register, during which Jesus gives a piece of bread to Judas (dressed in yellow and green) to indicate his knowledge of his betrayal, is depicted primarily according to the Gospel of John (13:21–30). In the lower register, Judas, realizing that his betrayal is understood, gets up suddenly to leave. His wooden stool topples over, and Christ’s words appear in a banderole: Quod facis fac cito (""What thou doest, do quickly,"" John 13:27). The two scenes are surrounded by an illusionistic border in liquid silver, with liquid gold acanthus, butterflies, and flowers. In the upper left of the border is the evangelist Matthew.",282

Here the margin prominently includes an illuminated roundel with an angel chasing a devil with a lance. As a time-saving device, illuminators in the 1450s and later would often paint identical borders on both sides of a leaf. The motifs would be drawn on one side and then traced on the other by holding the leaf against a window. The manuscript from which this leaf came is no longer intact. It included numerous painted roundels relating to the lives of Saint Catherine of Alexandria and the more obscure Saint Alexis. It is possible that the manuscript originally belonged to a married couple for whom these saints served as patrons.",744

Illuminated Folio from a Gulistan (Rose Garden) of Sa'di (c. 1213–1291),15th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Manuscript,"The border scene is set in a magical forest bursting with blossoms. At the top, a winged lion chases a winged deer, who is caught in the bottom border. The imagery of a lion biting down on its prey dates from the Achaemenid period in Iran (550–330 BCE) and references the valor of the king. A fox scurries off to the right. The verse is written in the Persian language using nastaliq script. Sultan ‘Ali Mashadi was widely renowned for perfecting the nastaliq script, and his calligraphy was a model for many followers across the Islamic world.",132
Illuminated Folio from a Gulistan (Rose Garden) of Sa'di (c. 1213–1291),15th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Manuscript,"In the border surrounding the Persian poetical text, deer and a lion coexist peacefully in a forest. This imagery may reference the rule of a righteous king. The text is from the Gulistan, one of the most celebrated works of Persian literature, completed around 1258. Gulistan means “Rose Garden” in Persian; just as a rose garden is a collection of flowers, the contents are a collection of anecdotes. This page is from the section “On the Conduct of Kings.”",132
Cutting from a Missal: Initial O with Christ Performing an Exorcism,16th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Manuscript,"This initial is probably the O beginning the Introit for the Third Sunday in Lent, Occuli mei semper ad Dominum (My eyes are ever towards the Lord). The Gospel reading from that Sunday tells the story of Christ casting out a demon. The artist's style is easily recognized in the facial features, and in the borders, in which he typically mixed still-life motifs, scattered small red and blue flowers, strawberries, and simulated pearls and jewels. Matteo's life dates are not known. His career probably began in Milan in the 1490s, but his name occurs in the accounts of the d'Este family at Ferrara from 1502 to 1512. The climax of Matteo's career was his activity in Rome, where he was apparently responsible for a number of luxury illuminated liturgical manuscripts. In 1520 he illuminated a missal for Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, the future Pope Clement VII (1523–34). The initial shown here comes from another missal that he must have illuminated around the same time. This missal was most probably in the Sistine Chapel sacristy when it was sacked by Napoleon's troops in 1798.",132

Leaf Excised from a Book of Hours: Decorated Initial H,15th Century,Netherlands,52.132633,5.291266,Europe and Central Asia,Manuscript,"The difficulty in localizing Dutch manuscripts of the second half of the 15th century is formidable. Many shared or exchanged characteristics are found, particularly in terms of page layout, border decoration, and initial design. The present leaf contains borders embellished with brightly colored flowers (columbines) and acanthus leaves filled in with gold bezants, tiny green leaves, and little black dots. Though different in palette, these elements bear closest resemblance to borders and initials produced by a group of artists associated with the Zwolle Bible (Utrecht, Universiteitsbibliotheek, MS. 31). The original illuminators are believed to have worked within the Monastery of the Canons Regular at Agnietenberg. This leaf is painted in an associated style by an artist who must have been familiar with the Zwolle group.",72
Leaf from a Book of Hours: Initial D,15th Century,Null,,,Null,Manuscript,"Not all books of hours were decorated with conventional historiated initials or full-page miniatures containing figural scenes.

"The Flowering of Joseph's Rod, folio 11 (verso), from a Mirror of Holiness (Mir’at al-quds) of Father Jerome Xavier",17th Century,Null,,,Null,Manuscript,"This painting illustrates a story that introduces Joseph into the narrative. When Mary came of age to wed, the high priests ordered every eligible man to bring a rod to the temple. When they prayed for a sign from God to determine which suitor was worthy, the rod belonging to Joseph burst into bloom. The painter has depicted Joseph’s hat on the ground as if it fell off his head in a sudden movement of surprise. The suitors in this scene are dressed as contemporary Portuguese men, but have followed the Muslim practice of removing their shoes while in the temple.",
"Royal Reception in a Landscape, left folio from the double frontispiece of a Shahnama (Book of Kings) of Firdausi (Persian, about 940–1019 or 1025)",15th Century,Null,,,Null,Manuscript,"The royal feast is set in a green landscape dotted with flowers and blossoming bushes against a gold sky with wisps of blue and white clouds. The group of figures in the upper left includes a falconer, horses, attendants, and two hunting cheetahs, while servers transport food and drink in gold and ceramic vessels, some presumably Chinese blue and white porcelain. Possibly this banquet was offered after a courtly hunt, a prestigious symbol of power and wealth. Among the groups of men sitting on elaborate carpets are three Chinese officials, identifiable by their black hats, kneeling together on the ground. Although their presence indicates the presence of foreign cultures within the Timurid court, the painting also reveals that not all are welcome to the feast; in the bottom half of the page a guard wields a stick to drive a group of men out of the garden.",
Cutting from an Antiphonary:  Initial A[spiciens a longe]: The Tree of Jesse,12th Century,Null,,,Null,Manuscript,"This complex initial ""A"" is formed of meandering plant tendrils, neatly and symmetrically placed at the center of a succession of square frames to which the letter is securely attached above and below. The whole forms a Tree of Jesse showing Christ's ancestors beginning with King David (bottom). The text would have begun, ""Long have I been watching...."" These are the words of Isaiah, who foresaw the coming of Christ. Isaiah's prophecies are the basis for the representations of the Tree of Jesse, often seen in medieval art.",
Bifolio from a Book of Hours: Initial V with Floral Border (recto); Text (verso),15th Century,Null,,,Null,Manuscript,"The word dirge, today meaning a mournful hymn for funerals, comes from the opening Latin in the Office of the Dead, seen just after the decorative letter A at upper left. During the Middle Ages, dirge became the shortened way to refer to the Office of the Dead. Although primarily recited at funerals, the office was also prayed at home as a reminder of mortality and a protection against sudden death. Surrounding the text, which contains Psalm 5, is a border decoration of acanthus leaves, believed to grow in paradise, as well as a parrot, a squirrel, a beetle, and flowers.",

Leaf from a Psalter and Prayerbook: Initial E with Ornamental Border Containing a Seated Satyr and a Bird Eating Grapes (recto) and Ornamental Border with Flowers and Squirrel (verso) (2 of 3 Excised Leaves),16th Century,Null,,,Null,Manuscript,"This leaf reveals the charm of secular decoration such as satyrs or domestic activities like cooking. Such details would have been a sumptuous delight to the original owner.

They represent the intricate decoration found throughout the parent volume, its leaves now dispersed.

Leaf from a Book of Hours: The Raising of the Cross,16th Century,Null,,,Null,Manuscript,"This finely painted miniature is the work of an artist familiar with the designs of Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528). Though not deriving from a known engraving or drawing, the style, composition, and especially the modeling of the figure of Christ refer to the draftsmanship and tonalities found in Dürer's works. This miniature depicts the moment the cross is raised. In the foreground, thuggish brutes struggle to bring it upright. The skull of Adam at the foot of the cross signifies that Golgotha was Adam's burial place. In the background, a vivid blue sky recedes into pink as it meets the horizon and a distant town. The inclusion of an illusionistic, trompe l'oeil border, strewn with flowers and butterflies on a gold ground, follows the tradition of Ghent and Bruges, where such borders were first developed during the 1470s and 1480s.",

These motifs depict a girl kneading bread, a cook ladling soup, a goose nibbling grapes off a vine, and a satyr with a horn. Such details would have been a sumptuous delight to the original owner.

Vase,19th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Metalwork,"In style, the vase is resoundingly eclectic. It derives its form from a slightly modified ancient Greek amphora-a two-handled jar having a narrow neck. Contemporaries described its style as neo-grec (new Greek) or Byzantine. Today, however, we would not choose those terms. It is true that the surface decoration of the vase is based upon the scrolling pattern of a classical acanthus design-an arrangement of leaves and flowers-but the sharp, spiky details point to possible Islamic modifications of this pattern. The colors of the enamels are related to medieval European examples, particularly 12th-century Netherlandish work from the Mosan region. The decoration of this vase exemplifies a technical innovation introduced by the Barbedienne firm around 1860. In casting the metal from which the piece is formed, many small grooves were created on its surface. Later these grooves and other broader recessed areas were filled with colored enamels to create a predetermined ornamental design.",744

Mirror with Six Circular Flowers,7th Century,Null,,,Null,Metalwork,"Around the mirror’s central knob, there are six floral designs set within circles, separated by candelabra-like dividers. These flower designs later became known as ""baoxiang hua 寶相花"" or ""flowers of precious appearance"", which often remind people of Buddhist connections. The design also includes a ribbon of inscription, praising the mirror’s clarity and celebrating the end of a war.",

Around the central knob are four leaves, a ring of tiny beads, and then a circle made up of small lotus flower designs. Outside of that are eight big petal shapes, inside each is a Sanskrit letter. The mirror has the phrase ""In the name of Om mani padme hum"" written in a slightly incorrect form of Sanskrit, possibly because the Chinese mirror maker was not familiar with the language.",

A few of these branches protrude beyond the beaded circular border to touch the edge of the outer circle, adding a playful dynamism. Similar motifs can be found on silver objects and porcelain of this period.",
Mirror,5th Century BCE,Null,,,Null,Metalwork,"Named for their figured handles, Greek caryatid mirrors may derive from similar types created in ancient Egypt many centuries earlier (like CMA 1983.196). Greek caryatid handles typically take the form of a beautiful, draped woman like this one, whether mortal or divine (perhaps the love goddess Aphrodite). Often, she holds a small offering, here a flower. The small, winged women (Nikai) flanking her are unusual among such mirrors, which often feature Erotes in this position. In antiquity, the unadorned disk would have been highly polished and reflective, and the figure would have stood on an integrated base.",

His hands are in the mudra communicating the transmission of the teachings.",
Octafoil Mirror with Two Immortals Crossing the Ocean,10th – 13th Century,Null,,,Null,Metalwork,"This mirror in the shape of a flower represents two immortals crossing the ocean, surrounded by surging waves. The younger figure on the left wears two buns on his head; the elder one with a long beard is carrying a musical instrument, sheng. The scene may illustrate “The Eight Immortals Crossing the Ocean,” in which their supernatural power to walk on water is depicted. The two men here stand on their swords to travel on water. In Daoist and Buddhist thinking, swords are considered powerful, magical implements to exorcise demons and destroy evil spirits.",

Hand Mirror,20th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Miscellaneous,"We often think of art as the work of just one person. In the case of this mirror, its harmonious appearance conceals the number of people involved in its creation. The designer Félix Bracquemond was commissioned by wealthy banker Baron Joseph Vitta to create decorative objects for his multiple homes. Bracquemond worked with other artists in making this mirror: well-known sculptor Auguste Rodin created the figure of Venus; artisan Alexandre Riquet fashioned the elaborate enameled decoration; and goldsmiths from Parisian jewelers Falize Frères completed the mirror and its blue translucent frame embedded with yellow, pink, and white flowers. Through close collaboration between patron, designer, and artists, this mirror represents the trend at the end of the 1800s for blending artistic specialties to create a single work of art. The CMA’s collection includes Bracquemond’s preparatory drawings for the mirror and Rodin’s carved plaster model for the figure of Venus.",744

Ink Flowers,14th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"Zhao Zhong's flowers, each paired with a poem, echo the fine-style colored flowers of the academic tradition, but instead he used only ink. Fine lines define the contours of each plant, as well as the veins within each petal and leaf. Careful ink washes give subtle modeling to the forms. The combination of lily, narcissus, and peony is unusual as the three belong to no known seasonal or symbolic system popular in the fourteenth century. Zhao’s medical training may have influenced the selection. Powdered lilies, for example, were prescribed to dispel grief, while the bark of tree peony roots was used as a treatment for various blood disorders.",1350
Flowering Crab Apple,16th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"Shen Zhou painted a broken branch (zhezhi 折枝) of crab apple, a fragment of nature rather than the full plant in its natural context. Shen uses calligraphic outlines in pure ink to depict the flower petals. The swift yet precise brushstrokes together with the slight S-shaped branch convey vitality. The inscription is a poem written by the artist, commenting on the lovely color and melancholic aura of the crab apple blossom. Shen Zhou is the founder of the Wu School, a group of scholars and officials active around Suzhou in eastern China, known for practicing painting and calligraphy in a refined and elegant style.",1350
"Flowers of Four Seasons, with Poems",16th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"In this painting, flowers are loosely arranged by the seasons: narcissus and peony represent early spring; yellow loquat and lotus, summer; chrysanthemum, autumn; and the plum and evergreen bamboo, winter. The artist added to each flower a poetic line of calligraphy associating each plant with a historic or legendary figure. For example, the chrysanthemum, along with the line “The untrammeled joy at the eastern fence,” refers to the poet Tao Yuanming (died AD 427) who enjoyed chrysanthemums at the eastern fence in his garden. The scroll illustrates Wang Guxiang’s mastery of free brushwork, combining light monochrome ink with transparent colors. In his inscription, Wang says he used the “boneless” style without outlines as developed during the Yuan dynasty (1279–1368). Wang was a native of Changzhou, a city in southeast China known for its rich flora and fauna, and flower-and-bird painting tradition.",1350
Quails and Sparrows in an Autumn Scene,14th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"The flower-and-bird subjects here are depicted in a meticulous manner, echoing the academic tradition but translating the customarily colored images to plain monochrome. Fine ink lines combined with carefully graded washes define the contours and give subtle modeling to the natural forms. Wang Yuan excelled in flower-and-bird subjects as well as landscape and figure paintings. A child prodigy, he was instructed by the great Yuan master Zhao Mengfu at an early age.",1350
Ink Plum,15th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"Seasonal paintings, including those depicting flowering plum trees in early spring, furnished scholars’ studios or other interior spaces in the house. Peng Xu is considered the foremost follower of the famous plum blossom painter Wang Mian (1287–1359) (see CMA 1974.26). The branches are brushed in the same vigorous manner leaving white streaks in the ink indicating the gnarled bark. The delicate blossoms are drawn in fine lines, while a gray wash covers the entire surface, only leaving the flower petals in reserve.",1350
"Album of Miscellaneous Subjects, Leaf 2",17th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"Leaf 2 This leaf is, perhaps, based on Du Mu's poetic line: The herdboy pointed to the distant Apricot Village. Han Tan's colophon reads: A thousand feet of red cliffs look like a sculptured flower of furong; In one glance, the long bridge joins adjacent ridges. Furthermore a wine shop stands in a bamboo grove; The fellow who bought some good wine is drunk on the eastern shore of the stream.",1350

Herbaceous Peony,17th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"Yun Shouping came from Piling (modern Changzhou), Jiangsu province, a center of floral, plant, and insect painting. He had joined the anti-Manchu resistance, was briefly imprisoned, and witnessed the death of family members in 1644. Like other artists, Yun Shouping expressed his Ming loyalism in coded pictures. The peony, king of flowers, and a spring garden motif developed new meaning during the Qing dynasty. The inscription indicates that Yun turns the flower into a motif representing the glorious past. The herbaceous peonies here appear somewhat withered and pale, with faint reddish veins running through its broken branches, perhaps a coded message. The inscription reads, An old painting by an anonymous painter of the Northern Song Dynasty has five varieties of flowers painted in the boneless manner. Its colors are so beguiling and beautiful, that even after several hundred years its lead pigments are like new. The skill with which the ink and colors were applied and the subtlety of its composition find no equal among modern followers.",1350
A Hundred Birds and the Three Friends,15th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"In this hanging scroll birds rest and frolic among pines, bamboo, and flowering plum, plants known as “the three friends.” Due to their endurance in winter, they symbolize perseverance and friendship in adverse times. The naturalistic depiction of the birds refers to the bird-and-flower painting tradition of the Art Academy of the Song dynasty. The painter Bian Wenjin served at the court of the Ming dynasty Yongle Emperor (reigned 1402–24). This painting may have been hung in a private studio or palace hall on appropriate occasions.",1350

Yellow Chrysanthemums and Red Osmanthus in the Style of Wang Yuan,15th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"Shen Zhou, a native from Suzhou, was descended from a prominent land-owning family with strong ties to literati culture. Because Shen Zhou never entered government service, he had ample opportunity to cultivate the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy.Chrysanthemums and red osmanthus both bloom in autumn. The deep orange osmanthus flowers emanate a characteristically sweet fragrance. According to his inscription on the painting, Shen Zhou sought to imitate the style of the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) painter Wang Yuan. His color-filled brushstrokes and washes, however, anticipate the flower painting style of Yun Shouping, whose Peonies are also in the Cleveland Museum of Art collection, https://www.clevelandart.org/art/1967.192.

Plum Blossoms and Peonies,18th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"One of the so-called Yangzhou Eccentrics (a group of painters who lived in Yangzhou and were known for their unorthodox art and lifestyle), Gao Fenghan depicts China’s two most loved flowers in full bloom—the “cold beauty,” or plum blossom, in the first section, and the “king of flowers,” or peony, in the second section. Painted in 1741, the year when Gao decided to leave the south and return home to Shandong province in eastern China, this work was likely a token of farewell. His casual brushwork may indicate his mental and physical struggle at the time. After having crippled his right hand in 1737, Gao used his left hand to paint and achieved a crudeness and eccentric style unattainable before.",1350
"Album of Miscellaneous Subjects, Leaf 8",17th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"Leaf 8 Li Bing's colophon reads: Maple leaves drift in the wind, the autumn gusts bracing, Hibiscus flowers steeped with water, the evening breeze light.

Fish and Rocks,17th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"Bada Shanren, also called Zhu Da, a 17th-century painter who rejected conventions in favor of an individual, personal expression, is known for his unorthodox compositions of fish, flowers, birds, and rocks. Fish in his paintings are often looking upward toward heaven, swimming in a pond of undefined space. As a member of the Ming imperial family, Zhu Da lost his princely status and hid in a monastery when the Manchus, foreigners from the north, established the Qing dynasty in 1644. This scroll may have some autobiographical meaning, representing fish as leftover subjects (yimin) who lived in a void, having lost their roles in life after the fall of the dynasty.",1350
Garden for Solitary Enjoyment,16th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"Garden of Solitary Enjoyment refers to a site built in 1073 by the statesman Sima Guang (1019–1086) after he had retired to Luoyang, Henan province. Every spring, visitors would flock to his garden. Each of its seven structures references a historic figure. Sima wrote: I channel streams [like Du Mu], to water flowers [like Bai Juyi], or trim bamboo [like Wang Huizhi]. . . . I know of no joy between heaven and earth that could take its place. Qiu Ying’s painting, created after an 11th-century version of the same theme, must have appealed to garden owners of the Ming dynasty, since it became the template for numerous Suzhou workshop copies",1350
Lily and Butterflies,14th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"The bird is represented in pale ink, probably sketched in before the darker ink was used to finish the rock. Like the butterfly and moth above, his tail feathers echo the bamboo as well as the leaves and petals of the flowers. The Chinese wagtail can connote brotherly love. The daylily was used for various pharmaceutical purposes, especially for deadening pain in childbirth. It was also considered efficacious in relieving grief and aiding in the production of sons. The lily is in fact the real subject of this painting: it is the common symbol for motherly love. Hence, the lingering of the butterfly over a lily can signify a son's love, devotion, and yearning for his mother—the refuge from worldly woes.",1350
Five Pine Trees,18th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"Li Shan was born into a family of scholars and officials in Yangzhou. The wealth and status of Li's family assured him an educational and cultural advantage, including his appointment at court. The subjects Li Shan chose to paint—orchids, bamboo, pines, and flowers—reflected his literati background. Five Pine Trees, painted late in his career, is an unconventional work. Rather than having focused on a realistic treatment of the subject, Li created the trees with an interplay of richly modulated strokes, while he utilized a semicursive script among the branches to illustrate the kinship between painting and calligraphy.",1350
"Album of Miscellaneous Subjects, Leaf 6",17th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"Leaf 6 Zhou Yi's colophon reads: The bright moon emerges through the willow, The fragrance of flowers is already difficult to retain. Listening above these tall branches, I sense that faraway in my native place autumn has arrived. Obstructed, all the diminished waters flow, Abruptly the sound of a lute wafts to and fro. A strong wind, unabated, blows among the willow branches.",1350
Chrysanthemums and Cabbage,15th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"On an autumn day in Beijing, Tao Cheng had a gathering with a group of scholar-officials and created two paintings in a spontaneous, casual style. The first depicts chrysanthemums, slender bamboo stalks, and a rock in monochrome ink. Tao applied light colors for the second painting that depicts cabbage. Tao deliberately placed the images on the first sections of the paper so that his honorable guests could add their poetic inscriptions inspired by his imagery. In the first section to the right, all seven poetic inscriptions refer to the beloved poet and recluse Tao Qian (also called Tao Yuanming, AD 365–427) who was particularly known for his profound love for chrysanthemum flowers. Most of the inscriptions in the second section express sympathy for the poor, since cabbage is the main ingredient in their humble food. Taken together, the poems and paintings allude to the life and responsibilities of the scholar-official: the importance of both an upright character and a concern for the poor citizens in order to achieve good government.",1350
Pipa (Loquats),19th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"The loquat is a plant native to China that produces a juicy, yellow fruit in early summer. The artist may have intentionally extended the branches beyond the paper to emphasize the abundance of fruit. Xugu’s subjects of flowers, goldfish, and loquats express wishes for abundance and wealth, and must have appealed to his patrons.Xugu gave up his career as a military official during the Taiping rebellion (1850–64) and became an itinerant monk who painted for a living. He spent the later years of his life in Shanghai and his fame as an artist is associated with that city.",1350

Plum Blossoms,18th Century,China,35.86166,104.195397,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"A native of Anhui province, Wang Shishen was a professional painter who specialized in plum blossoms. He moved to Yangzhou in the late 1720s to seek patrons. Here, the daring composition of a flowering plum branch is balanced through the addition of four poems. Wang’s poems evoke nostalgia for the forgotten Six Dynasties period and the glorious Sui dynasty, during which the Grand Canal was built while Yangzhou was the southern capital of the empire. Other inscriptions in the upper part of the painting allude to the fact that Wang had developed blindness in one eye, probably at the time he conceived this painting.",1350

Portrait of Mary Wise,18th Century,England,53.4084,2.9916,Europe and Central Asia,Painting,"Mary’s modest and contemplative demeanor is a counterpoint to a rather elaborate ensemble consisting of a gown embroidered with gold flower sprigs, trimmed with lace and pearls, and tied with a gold sash, as well as a gold-striped veil and a bracelet with eight gold bands.

Vase of Flowers,20th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Painting,"Known for his dark, velvety charcoal drawings and lithographs, Redon began working predominantly in oil and pastel after 1900, thus enlisting color in his explorations of the world of dreams and the imagination. Like other Symbolists, Redon searched for alternative experiences beyond the rational logic of Naturalism and Impressionism.

Painted with almost scientific accuracy, this still life has a freshness and immediacy derived partly from its composition. Isolated against a dark background, the fully mature peonies, potted hydrangeas, and basketed lilacs spill downward and outward from the geraniums at the rear. At the same time, Monet's energetic brushwork conveys the sparkling play of light on leaves and petals.",744
Self Portrait,19th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Painting,"François LePage belonged to a family of flower painters and worked in the French city of Lyon, which was famous for producing silk, particularly fabric with flower motifs.

"Festival of Flowers, Nice (Fête des fleurs)",20th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Painting,"While living in Nice after World War I, Matisse adopted a more relaxed style saturated with the warm colors of the Mediterranean. This painting depicts the view from the balcony of Matisse's room at the Hôtel de la Meditérranée overlooking the Promenade des Anglais in Nice. Pictured on the balcony are Matisse's daughter, Marguerite, and his model, Henriette, poised to toss their flowers to the participants in the parade below.",744
Basket of Anemones,20th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Painting,"Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso worked closely together in the invention of Cubism from 1908 to 1914. “We were like two mountain climbers roped together,” Braque recalled. They separated when Braque enlisted in the French army at the outbreak of WWI in August 1914. Following a severe head wound and hospitalization, he returned to painting in 1916, but worked alone developing a personal Cubist style concerned with complex spatial constructions, color relationships, and textured surfaces. The flowers and basket in this still life are flattened, pressed tightly against the upright forms in the background, and surrounded by an illusionistic shadow. A decorator’s comb was used to create the wood grain pattern in the tabletop.",744
Tulips,20th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Painting,"Henri Matisse, leader of the French Fauves (“Wild Beasts”), advocated the complete liberation of color from natural appearances and reducing formal elements to absolute essentials. “What I dream of,” he wrote, “is an art of balance, purity, and serenity.” In Tulips a vase of flowers floats mysteriously against fields of thinly applied turquoise, aqua, and lavender. While the colorful tulips express a joyful sentiment, the vase rests precariously on a planar shape, perhaps a tabletop. The uncertainty of the vase’s position as it extends over the edge, and whether the tabletop continues to the right through a plane of transparent color, together with the strange black rectangle in the background, inserts a contravening feeling of disquiet and visual tension into the time-honored genre of still-life painting.",744

This portrait certainly has this quality: the face has been idealized, smoothed, and perfected, but the focus of the painting is less on the Marquise and more on her elegant gown, which is a particularly fine rendering of eighteenth-century printed cloth, with the brilliant gold and white fabric strewn with meticulously detailed flowers and lace.",744

In the Forest,19th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Painting,"With its beautifully rendered trees, grassy slopes, and water bathed in late afternoon sunlight, this painting clearly suggests Nanteuil's love of nature. In 1837 he wrote to a friend: ""I often spend several hours . . . looking at beautiful plants with large leaves, cut out like sumptuous lace, tall grasses in ponds, their color silky and the beautiful reflections they make in the water, the little flowers with thousands of colours the ground is embroidered with, all provide me with a source of enjoyment."" Although the forest Nanteuil described seems very real, his painting includes a satyr. Seated on a stone near a stream, the half human, half goat mythological figure seems lost in the music he plays upon his pipes. Nanteuil is most famous for his lithographs and etchings; paintings by the artist are rather rare.",744

Women enjoying the river at the forest’s edge (recto) and flowering marigold (verso),18th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Painting,"The image of young women at play, in association with water and the fruiting of trees, such as this mango, has been used in Indian art to signal the idea of prosperity and abundance. Rain clouds approach that will nourish the land. The pairs of women on the banks sample perfumes, and in front of them bowls made of leaves appear to hold jasmine flowers for adorning the hair. One woman smokes a hookah and looks on as two companions frolic in the rivulet. The palace’s white marble buildings are barely indicated in the far distance.",132
A marbled picture of Rustam catching Rakhsh,17th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Painting,"This scene depicts the young hero Rustam catching a foal, Rakhsh (meaning “light”), who will be his faithful companion through many adventures. A prophet-like shepherd figure with a staff at the upper left predicts that Rustam will be the savior of Iran. At the top of the page a feline has caught its prey, while a hunter steps on its tail. This extraordinary painting has more applications of marbled colorant than any other known example. Even all the flowers and birds have been articulated through marbling in a feat of registration and control by a master of the technique.",132
Maharana Bhim Singh of Mewar (r. 1778–1828) with a Consort,19th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Painting,"The consort folds her hands in devotion to the Maharana whose glory is highlighted with a halo behind his head. The Maharana fondly holds the chin of his paramour and appears to be in the process of putting a garland around her neck. One of the most celebrated artists in the history of painting at Mewar, Chokha has nestled the couple in an overabundance of bolsters, their chamber covered with pink flower petals and draped with yellow garlands.",132
A night scene of Shiva puja (recto); Calligraphy (verso),18th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Painting,"Hindu women had been prominent members of Mughal harems since the time of Akbar, whose chief queen was a Hindu princess from the kingdom of Amber (later renamed Jaipur) in present-day Rajasthan. Under golden stars and a crescent moon, this royal palace woman holds a flower garland to offer at a shrine to the Hindu god Shiva. The light of butter lamps casts a shadow behind her figure; experimentation with the depiction of shadows, typically absent in earlier Mughal painting, increased among artists during the 1700s.",132
"Page from the Late Shah Jahan Album: Persian Calligraphy framed by an ornamental border of flowers, birds, and deer",16th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Painting,"About 100 years after the calligraphy was completed by a Persian master and embellished with gold and floral arabesques, the small page was mounted into an album for the Mughal emperor of India. Mughal artists filled the outer border with floral vines, blooming and budding with many varieties. Pairs of birds perch throughout; male and female deer relax, listening to the birdsong. The Indian artists chose to emphasize nature’s abundance and life-giving forces, whereas the Persian artists sought to achieve exquisite, gemlike refinement.The central poem, by Ibn-i Yamin (Persian, 1286–1368), encourages the reader not to worry about unexpected calamities.",132
A feast in a pavilion setting,17th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Painting,"Two gentlemen sit on a low carpeted platform in a walled garden.

Behind them is the entry of a wealthy family’s house with one of the double doors open, leading to the inner quarters and a covered pavilion on the rooftop.

Maharana Jagat Singh Attending the Raslila,18th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Painting,"To celebrate the New Year festival of Diwali, dancers reenact the life story of the Hindu god Krishna in a palace courtyard by candlelight under the full moon. The king, a vassal of the Mughal emperor, sits with the halo of divine sanction for his rule at the left of the courtyard, smoking from a golden goat-shaped hookah, with his young son and heir at his side. At the top of the composition, a dancer dressed in blue with a peacock-feather crown plays the part of Krishna. In the upper right corner, a canopy painted with swirling storm clouds stands for the rainstorm sent by the jealous king of the gods, who is shown in the middle of the canopy with his consort and mount, the elephant with seven trunks. Guards and grooms in the foreground entertain themselves with music while they wait with the horses of visiting nobles. The formal geometric gardens, playful use of perspective, and individualized portraiture indicate the selective adoption of the styles and sensibilities of the imperial Mughal court in the paintings from this large-format series.",132

In this Persian retelling of the Old Testament account from the Bible, Zulaykha lusted after Joseph, even though she was already married to Potiphar. Joseph, with the golden halo, resisted her advances until she became a widow and retained his youth, because of his extreme virtue. Above, Zulaykha as a young woman waits for Joseph in her house where murals of them as a happy couple are painted on the walls.",132
"Portrait of a kneeling holy man, from the Prince Salim Album",16th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Painting,"One of the few surviving works that appear to have been made by an artist brought from Iran by Akbar’s father, Humayun, shortly after his arrival in Mughal India, this page was mounted into the Prince Salim Album in his breakaway court in Allahabad. The flowing lyrical contour lines, penetrating expression, and soft yet wiry texture of the beard reveal the hand of a master. The verse written above and below the painting is a quotation from a poetic sermon of the Persian author Sana’i, who lived about 1100: If it were greed that led you to acquire learning, then be afraid, For at night, a thief with a torch can take away the choicest goods! The calligraphy suggests that the kneeling figure is a charlatan holy man who wears the blue robe of a Sufi mystic and acts with humility and piety for monetary gain rather than sincerity of devotion.",132
Krishna with Cow 2,20th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Painting,"Inspired by the bold style of Kalighat paintings, Jamini Roy created paintings using indigenous materials, often with multiple versions of the same subject.

"Sakhi Persuades Radha to Meet Krishna, from a Gita Govinda (Song of the Cowherd) of Jayadeva",19th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Painting,"While all the cowherd girls were in love with Krishna, he had a favorite according to texts of the 1200s and later. Her name was Radha, and she and Krishna would meet for secret trysts in the forest, facilitated by her sakhi, or confidante. Krishna is shown twice in this painting. At the right he is in the process of making a bed of leaves for their upcoming encounter, and in the middle, he spies on Radha, wearing orange and gold. The sakhi is encouraging Radha to go and meet Krishna, since he is pining for her.",132
Winter and Summer Flowers,17th Century,Japan,36.204824,138.252924,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"White camellias bloom behind a large pine in the right screen and blue morning glories creep through bamboo in the left screen of this composition.

Birds and Flowers,16th Century,Japan,36.204824,138.252924,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"The landscape depicted in this pair of screens follows a seasonal progression from right to left, starting with the blossoming plum of early spring and ending with late autumn peonies. A variety of smaller birds are positioned throughout the scene, and a trio of swimming ducks is bracketed by early summer irises and early autumn bellflowers at the center. While some raptors (birds of prey) terrorize a pheasant and an egret (a waterfowl) to the right, a peacock and peahen converse to the left. Hawks are associated with military prowess, while the peafowl suggest cultural prestige.",1374
A Beauty,19th Century,Japan,36.204824,138.252924,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"Many ukiyo-e paintings and prints focus on bijin (美人), or “beautiful people.” Female courtesans and entertainers were the main draw in the pleasure district of Edo (now Tokyo), but young men were also available. The poem here reads as follows: ""The full blooming cherry / is not the only flower worth mentioning. / The color of the young plum tree / blooms as well.""The full blooming cherry is a metaphor for mature women, and the plum for young men.",1374
Birds and Flowers in a Landscape of the Four Seasons,16th Century,Japan,36.204824,138.252924,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"The monk-painter Sesshp is revered today, as he was in his own time. While he left Kyoto's sophisticated intel-lectual and cultural environment to live in a provincial village in a far western province, he seems never to have severed contacts with the monastic communities of his young adulthood. His residence in Yamaguchi proved fortuitous because his patron, the region's military lord, enjoyed considerable freedom in conducting trade missions overseas with Korea and China. Sesshp went to China in 1467 and traveled about the country, visiting well-known historical sites and Chan (Zen) temples before returning two years later. Thus he became familiar with contemporary painting practices, materials, formats, and subject matter.

Sesshp's name here, as on a handful of similar bird-and-flower byøbu, attests to the master's identification at that time with the colorful mural paintings on the same theme emanating from Ming dynasty China. This genre had heretofore been relegated to hanging scroll compositions, so the intro-duction into temple and daimyo residences of such an attractive theme surely caused considerable excitement in the later fifteenth century, when in all likelihood Sesshp introduced it into the Japanese painting reper-toire. Subsequently, artists of varying backgrounds and training tried their hands at these large, dramatic scenes. From right to left the composition portrays an array of flowering plants in the near distance that indicate the passage of the seasons.

The unbalanced nature of the compositions, however, suggests they may be images recycled from larger paintings. The one with sweet osmanthus and hibiscus is an autumn scene, the other is a summer scene with daylilies and gardenias. Folding screens often contrast two seasons or depict all four across a single pair of screens. Sesshū’s works were sufficiently prized that repurposing them in fragmentary form to display in an alcove of a luxurious room would not be an unusual choice.",1374

It was produced late in the career of the artist, whose oeuvre includes landscapes, bird-and-flower and figure paintings in ink and sometimes bright colors.

There he came upon a small stream, the banks of which were covered with blooming irises, on which the artist has chosen to focus our attention.

Plum Tree,18th Century,Japan,36.204824,138.252924,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"Ogata Kōrin had to think through his design carefully to create these white plum blossoms and deliver their effect, as he used the reserve technique—where selected areas of the painting surface are left unpainted—to achieve it. He probably roughed in the tree before applying an ink wash to the entire silk surface, except where he intended to place the flowers. He likely then returned to articulate the petals and, in some cases, the pistils and stamens. The composition shows the tree twisting out of view, only to return with a branch of new growth jabbing forth from an old, broken limb, thereby heightening the visual impact of the blossoms.",1374
Symbols of Longevity: Deer under Peach and Pine,19th Century,Japan,36.204824,138.252924,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"This pair of hanging scrolls is replete with images symbolizing longevity. Peaches, associated with immortality, hang in abundance from a tree in the left scroll, while pines, known for being eternally green, twist together in the right scroll. Beneath the trees stand two bucks, one of whom gazes at a doe seated on the ground as he licks his coat. Medicine made from deer antlers is said to promote health. Mushrooms, in bright red and green, seen in the left scroll, are said to confer immortality upon those who eat them, and the small waterfall in the right scroll speaks to the infinite flexibility and abundance flowing through life. Toda Tadanaka, the son of the ruler of Noto province and a military leader himself, trained with trained with Mori Ransai (1740-1801), a painter known for colorful bird-and-flower compositions in the style of Shen Nanping.

Phoenixes and Paulownia,16th Century,Japan,36.204824,138.252924,East Asia and Pacific,Painting,"The immense heraldic birds on display in these byøbu reflect the Momoyama era's spirit of newly gained self-confidence and an affinity for grand expressive statements in painting, architecture, the textile and ceramic arts, as well as garden design. While that period preceded the arrival of prosperity, it clearly marked an extra---ordinary moment in Japanese cultural history, one frequently compared with the twelfth century of the Heian period. Through the extensive use of gold-foil backgrounds rather than the somber palette of carefully orchestrated ink tones evident in Muromachi byøbu, patrons colla-borated with artists as well as craftsmen in fostering a decidedly new look in much of Japanese painting. Here for instance there is no imaginary vista suggesting China's vast waterways and mountain ranges. The setting is composed instead of highly stylized lozenges of mineral green paint, suggesting the earth from which clumps of grass, flowering plants, and towering bamboo and paulownia trees emerge. Clusters of lumpy, blue-green rocks dotted with lichen provide stabilizing three-dimensional foils for these islands of vegetation as well as the all-encompassing flat, golden surface. The glorious artificiality of the setting precisely serves the artist's effort to compose a credible yet other-worldly vista for depicting the legendary phoenix gazing across the landscape at the pair of peacocks. Rather than an emblem of immortality, as it is in Western lore, in Japan the phoenix evolved out of its origins in Chinese mythology to become, by the sixteenth century, an auspicious symbol of political authority. Together with clusters of the distinctively shaped paulownia leaves, this long-tailed, mythical bird graced lacquerware as well as mural paintings, proclaiming an air of graceful com-mand. A characteristic infusion of temporality has been included also, through a seasonal flowering schema extending from spring to early summer (right) to fall and the advent of winter (left). Although traditionally attributed to the Tosa school master Tosa Mitsuyoshi (1539-1613), these byøbu possess neither seals nor signatures to confirm that authorship. Known for his jewel-like, modest-sized album paintings of courtly narratives such as The Tale of Genji, it is likely both studio training and contemporary fashions in patronage conspired to produce a good number of such byøbu.

The plum was also widely depicted in Korean paintings as part of the Four Gentlemen—or Four Gracious Plants—motif. Here, the plum and bamboo express literati spirituality while the bird with its head pointing downward indicates the artist’s feelings about the unstable situation at the end of the Joseon period.

A simple glass flask is filled with a large rose, a red anemone, and a white narcissus tinged with pink. These flowers are surrounded by a scattering of smaller blossoms. Like many still-life painters, Verelst depicted a window reflected in the glass vase, but here he did not show the window's precise structure. He did, however, use another common device: the depiction of a few chips in the stone surface to make the material seem more tangible. Early in his career, Verelst moved from Holland to London, where he worked for the court of King James II and was extravagantly praised for the realism of his flower paintings.",72
Chrysanthemum,20th Century,Netherlands,52.132633,5.291266,Europe and Central Asia,Painting,"Fascinated by the complex structure of chrysanthemums, Mondrian painted these delicate flowers throughout his career. This single, frontal blossom recalls the stylized chrysanthemums of Japanese prints. Mondrian added the initials and date near the bottom edge sometime after painting the flower. Since he returned to this subject repeatedly, even during his later years, this painting may have been produced as late as 1942, the year Mondrian exhibited it in New York.",72

Gooseberries—a modest, local pleasure—could be picked in the wild, although Dutch gardeners in the 1600s were the first to cultivate them to improve their taste. The strong illumination gives the plant a stark grandeur, despite the small scale, and the dark background emphasizes the fruit's delicate translucency.

Vase with flower arrangement and scrollwork,18th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"The symmetry of the floral arrangement emerging from the blue-and-white porcelain vase reveals an idealized vision. The overflowing vase is among the most ancient motifs in Indian art, used to convey the concept of abundance. This image, made for an elite patron of northern India, implies the prosperity that has accrued from international connections. The vase, painted with a European-style landscape, is of the type that was made in China for export to Europe.

Bodhidharma Crossing the Yangzi on a Reed,14th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"Chan Buddhism was introduced to China in the early 500s by the Indian monk Bodhidharma, or Puti Damo (died before 534). Upon his arrival in China, Bodhidharma was allegedly granted an audience with the Liang dynasty emperor Wu (reigned 502–49). Realizing the emperor did not understand his mission, the monk left Nanjing, crossed the Yangzi on a reed, and settled north in Henan province’s Shaolin monastery. Here, Bodhidharma is sketched in few pale brushstrokes. The diluted and swift lines on an empty ground emphasize the Chan idea that all things are illusionary. The inscription reads: Wind rises from the reed flowers, the waves are high; It’s a long way to go beyond the cliff of the Shaoshi mountain; Above the worlds of kalpas a flower is opening into five petals; So that your barefoot heels are just fine for the whipping rattans. —translated by Wai-Kam Ho",
Divine couple seated in a lotus blossom,19th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"A gigantic, thousand-petaled lotus flower provides an intimate setting for the lovers. They sit on the seed pod of another full-blown lotus flower, which indicates their transcendent nature by elevating them from the mire of the earth. Shown with full face forward in all white, the four-armed male deity has the all-seeing third eye in his brow and holds only a manuscript. The red goddess on his lap grasps a lotus flower in one hand, which communicates her benign and peaceful nature.

Bird on a Flowering Branch,12th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"A male redstart, a type of small bird, sits hunched on the branch of a flowering plum tree in early spring. The bird’s plumage is rendered in fine detail with a great naturalistic sense, characteristic of Southern Song court painting. While redstarts tend to spend the winter in warmer climates, they may have been seen during the mild winters in China’s southeast in Hangzhou, the seat of the former imperial painting academy where this album leaf was presumably produced. The small square painting must have once been part of an album. When collected in Japan, it was mounted as a hanging scroll, presumably to fit it in an alcove to be enjoyed during the tea ceremony.",
Birds and Flowers,19th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"The image depicted on this folding screen is not executed in ink, but rather a method called “pyrography"" or ""nakhwa,” a technique of burning the surface of materials ranging from wood to paper with the delicately controlled application of a heated metal tool.

Insects and Flowers,20th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"More than 26 feet long, this scroll presents insects, reptiles, and plants in delicate brushwork and pale colors, referring in style to earlier Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279) bird-and-flower paintings. Upon closer inspection, ants dismember a butterfly and reptiles wait to ambush their prey.An inscription at the end of the painting gives us an idea of its meaning: Attributed to the Qing dynasty scholar Zhang Xigeng (張錫庚, 1801–1861), the inscriber relates the work to an earlier painting by Qian Xuan (錢選, c. 1235–before 1307) and further suggests that the painting may allude to the relentlessness of natural selection. By drawing a parallel to tumultuous episodes in Chinese history, the writer might even hint at the domestic rebellions and the aggression of Western powers against China in his lifetime, particularly the Opium Wars (1839–60).",

The tiger sinks into the river, from where he will be retrieved and offered with all honor and ceremony to a religious leader who will see to it that the shakti, or divine creative energies embodied by the tiger, be translated into blessings and prosperity for the kingdom. This example of a ritual tiger hunt belongs to a genre known as Rajput painting, made at the courts of kingdoms in Rajasthan that were under the aegis of the Mughal empire.

"The prince, with the help of Mukhlis who changes into a frog, recovers the ring lost in the sea, and returns it to the king, from a Tuti-nama (Tales of a Parrot): Eighteenth Night",16th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"The prince arrived at a royal capital, where he pledged to assist the local king in any tasks. One day, when fishing at sea, the king dropped a precious ring into the water. The prince asked his servant, the frog, to retrieve it. At the left, the prince respectfully returns the ring to the king on his throne. The frog is at the entrance of the walled harbor to the sea, where a boatman bails water. Lotus flowers have been painted among the swirling eddies.",
The Heroine Who Waits Anxiously for Her Absent Lover (Utka Nayika),19th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"Inspired by devotional poetry that likens the waiting for divine favor to that of a woman alone in the forest waiting for her lover, Pahari painters mastered portrayals of this subject. Darkness has fallen, but the moon and stars and jasmine flowers brighten the night. However, monsoon clouds approach in the distance, suggesting impending danger and misery. Her gesture and expression suggest a mixture of hope and heightened uncertainty about how much longer she should continue to wait.",

Gaudi Ragini,18th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"Adept in the arts of love, according to the verse, a sixteen-year-old girl “tarries in the garden, confused of mind,” holding flowers from the wishing tree, no companion with her. Four black bucks seem to have emerged from the dense woods, attracted to her, while monkeys leer at her from above. The shining white architecture atop sherbet-hued walls and the tall peaked hill are characteristic of paintings from the Rajput kingdom of Amber, which would later be renamed Jaipur. The music of Gauri Ragini is intended to be enjoyed during the winter months.",
Peonies,13th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"In China, the peony is considered the Queen of Flowers, representing the late spring season. The shrubs of this tree peony are in full bloom, blossoming in various colors. Peony paintings were popular from the Southern Song period to the Ming dynasty. The large scale of this decorative scroll suggests that it may have been hung in a reception hall, conveying good wishes for wealth and prosperity.",
Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur (reigned 1635–1678),17th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"Mughal emperors forged alliances with the Hindu rulers of territories under their control by offering them positions of military authority within the Mughal court. Jaswant Singh, the raja (ruler) of Jodhpur, served as a military officer under the emperors Shah Jahan (reigned 1627–58) and Alamgir (also known as Aurangzeb; reigned 1658–1707). The flowering plants at the end of his sash became popular during the reign of Shah Jahan. His military accouterments include two swords and a stabbing dagger. The sensitive shading and mode of dress are closely based on Mughal styles, indicating Jodhpur’s close allegiance to the Mughal empire.",
"Radha Awaiting Reconciliation with Krishna, from a Gita Govinda of Jayadeva",17th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"The artist has depicted Krishna’s favorite lover, Radha, six times to emphasize her agitation while she waits for Krishna. She has made intimate enclosures of flowering branches for their tryst, she pleads with a picture of him, and she lays out blossoms and liquor under a tree in preparation. Her confidante makes an appeal to Krishna who sits under a tree at right, seemingly unmoved and dispassionate. The viewer is meant to put oneself in the place of Radha, and feel her intense longing for Krishna. Even when it seems like the god does not come when he promises, that he does not care, the devotee, like Radha, should continue to wait and prepare to receive him.",
Gunakali Ragini,18th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"Paintings made in the city of Jaipur took on a confectionary palette that became popular among newly expanded markets around India and abroad. With the disintegration of centralized imperial power, the Rajput kingdom of Jaipur began independently producing art that had mass appeal. Sets of paintings by royal court artists, such as the Ragamala series from which this page came, were made for sale, rather than for the private collection of the king. The revenues from their sale ensured the prosperity of the kingdom. The verse associated with Gunakali Ragini, a wintertime raga, states that the heroine “sets mandara flowers in a golden jar and seated, plucks them, with her mind fixed on love’s sport.”",
Blessed Lord Buddha,19th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"The central figure of the Buddha, radiating light and the flame of enlightenment, is flanked by his four main disciples: Sariputra and the blue Moggallana on his left, and Ananda and Anuruddha on his right. Below him is the earth goddess holding a pot of water on her head. To her right are three guardians of Sri Lanka: Kataragama (or Skanda) with six heads and twelve arms; the blue Vibhishana, younger brother of Ravana; and, smaller in size, may be Pattina holding an anklet and neem leaf. On the opposite side are three deities: Sumana, the four-faced Brahma, and four-armed Shiva with trident. Arranged around two depictions of the bodhi tree under which the Buddha reached enlightenment, rows of other monks bear garlands in veneration. Each of the standing protector divinities around the periphery grasps a bow and arrow.This painting evokes the appearance of 18th- to 19th-century murals in Sri Lankan Buddhist temple interiors, such as those at Dumbulla, with its rows of golden figures. It was probably part of a domestic shrine, along with small sculptures of the Buddha, palm-leaf manuscripts of Pali scriptures, incense, oil lamps, bells, and other offerings such as food, flowers, and water. The varnish that covers the painting may have been intended to shield it from the environment of an active place of worship.",

Eagles,14th - 17th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"Two eagles, painted in fine brushwork, perch on top of rocks surrounded by water, flowering camellia, and other vegetation, brushed in sweeping and broad strokes. Among birds, a favorite subject in Chinese painting, depictions of eagles can be traced back to at least the fourth century.Due to dramatic sociopolitical changes during the foreign-ruled Yuan (1279–1368) and native Ming dynasties, an elaborate symbolic language of the eagle developed. It can represent a vicious attacker, a courageous hero, or an enlightened emperor. In this painting, the two eagles are depicted peacefully resting in a lofty position, perhaps an idealistic image for a wise emperor and empress.",

Shri Raga: An Illustration from a Ragamala Series,18th Century,Null,,,Null,Painting,"The verse associated with Shri Raga corresponds closely with this scene:   His body, bluish in hue, is marvelously built.  He is always graced with the company of auspicious Shri Lakshmi.  He sits on a throne of gold, and before him Narada sits playing on his vina.  He has decorated himself with garlands of flowers, and also with ornaments set with jewels.  Shri raga is thus conceived in sentiment, of whom all learned men sing praises. The horse-headed figure claps his hands and accompanies the sage, wearing saffron garments and playing on the stringed instrument called a vina. He may be derived from the courtly commander of Indra, seen in the Jain manuscripts. Poppies bloom in the formal garden below the pure white terrace, and they are echoed by the oranges set on the windows of the house at the upper right.",
"Bull Skull, Fruit, Pitcher",20th Century,Spain,40.463667,-3.74922,Europe and Central Asia,Painting,"Picasso painted this still life on January 29, 1939, just after the death of his mother and the fall of his beloved Barcelona to the fascists during the Spanish civil war. This painting expresses Picasso's despair through the bull's skull covered with decaying flesh, perhaps symbolizing brutality and darkness. Amid the horror and anguish, a flowering tree referring to the sacred oak of Guernica sprouts in the moonlight, suggesting hope for the rebirth of democracy in Spain.",7
Our Lady of Good Counsel,17th Century,Spain,40.463667,-3.74922,Europe and Central Asia,Painting,"This painting loosely and inventively depicts an actual chapel in the former Jesuit Imperial College in Madrid, which housed a Madonna and Child in gilded and painted wood, a focus of popular devotion. Pérez made temporary decorations for the Spanish court, none of which survive, but the fanciful architecture, curiously inverted obelisks, fruits and flowers, and pastel colors all stem from this side of his work. By representing a polychrome sculpture in two dimensions, Pérez further blurred boundaries between painting and sculpture. This intersection of the spiritual and the real worlds was important in Spanish art of the 1600s.",7
White Flower,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Painting,"O’Keeffe is best known for close-up flower subjects whose magnified forms fill the entire space of each canvas. Likely inspired by similar compositions in modern photography, these images are not only celebrations of natural forms, but also striking essays in abstract design. Although many critics interpreted O’Keeffe’s flower paintings as reflections of femininity in general and female sexuality in particular, the artist strongly opposed such readings. Throughout most of her career, she frequently attempted to persuade others to discuss her work without referring to her gender, writing on one occasion, “I have always been very annoyed at being referred to as a ‘woman artist’ rather than an ‘artist.’”",1029

Sandy and Her Husband,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Painting,"In Sandy and Her Husband, the dancing couple at the center of the image is joined by Amos herself: the artist inserted herself into the picture by rendering an earlier self-portrait, Flower Sniffer (1966), which hangs on the wall behind the couple. However, even as Amos is part of the composition, she is peripheral to the scene, unseen or ignored by the dancers. From the early 1960s until her death in 2020, Amos made paintings, prints, and textiles celebrating African American identity and culture, and often exploring women’s presence within that heritage.",1029

Fletcher, to do studies for a projected (though never published) book on hummingbirds. As an outgrowth of that experience, Heade made a large number of paintings of birds and flowers, especially orchids, in a tropical setting. In this way he combined his main interests of still life and landscape--a union of themes he maintained in his work into the 20th century. The paintings are characterized by meticulous and precise rendering of detail and high-keyed luminescent color.",1029
Some More,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Painting,"During the final quarter century of her career, Joan Mitchell made a significant number of multipanel paintings, including Some More, comprising three equal-sized canvases whose composition bridges their shared edges. While the painting’s color and texture connote nature—such as a bed of flowers or shimmering sunlight—its rhythmic interaction of brushwork also suggests a source in music. In fact, Mitchell loved listening to opera while working in her studio during this period.",1029

A frequent motif in this body of work is a cloth-covered table prepared for entertainment that takes center stage. Here, the table displays a bowl of fruit, vases of flowers, and bottled beverages.

Still Life with Cantaloupe,19th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Painting,"Brown's early works were softly painted, romantic landscapes, but in the 1860s he turned almost exclusively to still lifes. He renounced the fluid style of his earlier landscapes and began to paint carefully contrived arrangements of fruit and flowers with almost photographic clarity.

He explained that ""the canvas you have chosen...is one that I enjoyed painting very much indeed. It came after a visit with my family in North Carolina several years ago. I remember so well as I went down on the train, drinking in every bit of the landscape from the windows, noticing the flowering trees becoming fuller and fuller as I got nearer to my home. The yellow and reddish browns in the earth against the many tones and shades of greens and the blooming trees made me want to stop, then and there, and start painting. But that was not possible until my return. So from memory and imagination, the painting was done.""",1029

Funerary papyrus,11th - 8th Century BCE,Egypt,26.820553,30.802498,Middle East and North Africa,Paintings,"Third Intermediate Period. Fragment of the funerary papyrus of the Priest of Amon, Jekhonsefonkh: There are two scenes, both perhaps incomplete. The accompanying text is lost. A: At the right of the fragment is the god Osiris, a mummiform figure, enthroned, wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt and carrying his usual attributes, a scepter in the form of the shepherd's crook and the whip. Above is a legend of three vertical lines reading in order from right to left: ""May Osiris, Lord of Eternity, First of the Westerners (i.e. the beatified dead) grant a nysut dy hotep (funerary offerings; literally ""an offering which the king gives""). Before the god are numerous offerings, among which one may distinguish loaves of bread, a bunch of onions, a cut of meat, grapes and lotus flowers. Standing before the god and holding a jar of milk (to judge by the form of the jar--that regularly used to contain milk and used as a hieroglyph--""milk"") is the deceased, the person for whose benefit the papyrus was inscribed and decorated and in whose tomb it was preserved to modern times. His head is shorn as befitted a priest and he wears an elaborate costume of thin, white linen. Above in the legend, read from left to right: ""the wab-priest-in-front-of-Amon, Jekhonsefonkh, beatified."" B: At the right of the left-hand scene, Jekhonsefonkh is seen again; one hand is held by a lioness-headed goddess, who turns to look into his face, his other hand is raised in the ritualistic gesture expressing adoration. The identifying legend above the priest's figure is the same as in A. The goddess is not named and may be any one of a number of lioness-headed divinities of whom the most important is Sekhmet. Apparently the goddess is presenting the deceased to an assembly of the weird beings who people the Netherworld. Unfortunately, for the most part, their names are not recorded; instead, in every available space, Osiris, Lord of Eternity, etc. (various epithets) is called on ""to grant funerary offerings.""",65

Nymphéa,20th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Photograph,"A prolific Parisian artist who enjoyed a three-decade career, Atget was one of the most important and original photographers active at the beginning of the 20th century. This sparkling landscape of a mass of white water lily blossoms (Nymphéa) is among Atget's best compositions, created in the 1920s, when he was at the height of his artistic prowess. This scene, full of luxurious botany, was probably taken in Bagatelle Park at the edge of Paris's Bois de Boulogne. He carefully focused on the floating plants and their sculptured flowers, detailing texture and shape. The early morning illumination created light and shadow patterns that enabled Atget to isolate flat, abstracted forms while simultaneously depicting a deep pictorial space. In this lush, purplish print, the lily pond shimmers with reflected shadows and brilliant highlights.",744
Untitled,21st Century,Japan,36.204824,138.252924,East Asia and Pacific,Photograph,"Now in his eighties, infirmities and the pandemic have led Araki to turn his camera on his neighborhood and his home, which is filled with small tableaux created with toys and artificial flowers, among other items. This close-up of a demon doll, set apart from a jumble of other small figures, reflects that limited scope while suggesting the photographer’s continued gusto for life and impish personality.",1374
Octopus and Melon,20th Century,Japan,36.204824,138.252924,East Asia and Pacific,Photograph,"Michiko Kon has created a remarkable body of work by assembling and photographing intricate still-life compositions. She employs a variety of materials in her constructions, such as fragments of raw fish, vegetables, flowers, and insects. Kon chooses perishable subjects, hoping to stimulate the viewer's five senses and ""because life contains a delicate beauty that attracts other objects, and a time limit."" A fish market near her studio supplies much of the matter for Kon's works, including Octopus and Melon. The halved melon, covered with the skin of an octopus, alludes to the themes of life, death, and female sexuality.",1374
Untitled (portrait of a man with glasses and mustache set into flower design),20th Century,Null,,,Null,Photograph,"This Hindu gentleman’s wedding portrait recalls the roundels of flowers with the bust or face of a nature divinity in the center, often found on the railings or fences separating sacred from mundane space. Those auspicious divinities personify the life-giving forces of nature. Here the groom becomes a personification of wealth and abundance, his clothing updated to accord with the fashions of the day.",
"Child Standing on a Chair Holding Flowers, with Mother",19th Century,Null,,,Null,Photograph,"Until the mid-1850s the daguerreotype process was the method preferred by the commercial photographers willing to meet the ever-growing demand for likenesses of family and friends. This daguerreotype captures the patience of a mother and child, who were required to hold their poses for some time during the exposure of the silver-coated copper plate. Only the bouquet of flowers held by the child is slightly blurred. Characteristic of the technique, the details in the image—fabric, facial features, and accessories—are clearly defined.",
Homestead with picket fence and flowers,19th Century,Null,,,Null,Photograph,,
Dead Child On a Sofa,19th Century,Null,,,Null,Photograph,"This carefully staged daguerreotype of a dead child is an outstanding example of a very common subject: the postmortem portrait. Using the stylistic conventions of the day, the unidentified artist successfully created a visually pleasing scene, despite the nature of the image. Dressed in white with a bouquet of flowers on the chest, the child, seen in profile, reclines on an elaborately patterned sofa. Delicate flesh tones were added to the cheek and arm, suggestive of a healthy child sleeping. The high rate of infant mortality throughout the 19th century made this variety of portraiture common, satisfying the emotional need of the parents to have a lasting memory of a loved one.",
Untitled (portraits in palms with henna),20th Century,Null,,,Null,Photograph,"Two hands of a bride, with a ring on every finger and vegetal patterns drawn in henna, offer superimposed photographic images of a man and woman––probably the bride and groom––as though they are gifts of coins or flowers to the viewer. Their beautiful faces stand for the auspiciousness that their marriage and wealth imply. Jewelry and fancy textiles are seen in the background, colored with a translucent tint of turquoise blue. This color is associated in Muslim circles with paradise, but the groom’s tilak, a mark on the forehead, indicates that he is Hindu.",
Thiaroye 1944,21st Century,South Africa,-30.559482,22.937506,Sub-Saharan Africa,Photograph,"These men represent Senegalese Tirailleurs, West African soldiers serving in the French army. Those who had been prisoners of war in World War II learned that they would receive no back pay and smaller pensions than white prisoners of war. They protested at Thiaroye; some were killed and many imprisoned. That revolt sparked a nationalist movement in Senegal that eventually liberated the country from French colonial rule.",4

Face Lift No. 3,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Photograph,"This self-portrait shows the artist recovering from her face lift. It was taken in daylight in a garden, probably her own given the airplane whirligig, which references Noggle’s years as a professional pilot. To her face she holds a flower, a traditional symbol of the fleeting nature of female beauty. This image refutes that idea, suggesting that aging can be fought, but at a price.",1029
Portrait of a Woman with Flowers,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Photograph,"For more than 50 years, James VanDerZee produced images that embody the spirit of Harlem. From the 1920s to the 1940s, he was the neighborhood's most popular and prolific photographer, his camera capturing everyone from ordinary citizens to celebrities. In the studio VanDerZee photographed glamorously dressed young people and dignified men and women. On location, he chronicled picnics, parades, families, church congregations, and the dead in their coffins. These four prints, from a collection of 33 recently acquired by the museum, show VanDerZee's skill at posing and lighting his subjects. His artistic sensibilities are reflected in elaborate backdrops and the use of accessories that reinforced his sitters' associations with culture and wealth. The artist worked with a variety of techniques, including multiple negatives and hand coloring, to make artful photographs that set him apart from his more traditional, less aesthetically inclined competitors. Just as he often signed his name and date directly onto the negative, he would also selectively draw on it-to smooth a complexion and touch up imperfections, or to add extra jewelry or smoke drifting from a cigarette-whatever was necessary to emphasize the grace and dignity of his client, regardless of race, age, or social status.",1029
Black and White Lilies III,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Photograph,"In the early 1920s, Cunningham combined the clarity and directness of modernism with her long-held interest in botanical imagery. For two decades she created a remarkable group of close-up studies of plants and flowers that identified her as one of the most sophisticated and experimental photographers working in America. In this dramatic, tightly cropped composition, Cunningham isolated two lilies against a simple velvet backdrop. A black calla (arum palaestium) was rhythmically placed in front of a white calla (zantedeschia aethiopica). The expanded scale of the black flower, with its partially visible spadix diagonally positioned, dominates the picture. The sculptural shapes and rich textures were emphasized by the combination of daylight and blue tungsten photofloods and the copious detail provided by the 8x10-inch negative. This sensuous print also encompasses a luxurious range of tones, from velvety black to milky white.",1029

Yet his portraits of family and friends, nudes, and still lifes demonstrate his versatility. This photograph, depicting the stems of cut flowers in a reflective glass bowl, comes from a series that Friedlander made while recovering from knee surgery. Through his keen powers of observation and conceptualization, he transformed the stems into a striking abstract composition of bold geometric forms, bathed in warm, atmospheric light. Aspects of the photographer's distinctive style-a close-up viewpoint, foreshortening, compressed space, and layering-appear in this work.",1029

"Portrait of Anne Law (née Towry), 1st Lady Ellenborough",19th Century,England,53.4084,2.9916,Europe and Central Asia,Portrait Miniature,"John Linnell was born and lived much of his young adulthood in Bloomsbury, where his father, James, made picture frames and restored paintings. As a boy the artist trained briefly with Benjamin West (1738–1820) and John Varley (1778–1842) before becoming a student at the Royal Academy from 1805 to 1812. Though primarily known for his landscapes, Linnell was also a prolific portraitist and executed miniatures during the first two decades of his career, learning the medium from his neighbor James Holmes (1770–1860). According to an early biographer, Linnell began painting miniatures around 1818 with a portrait of his wife. By 1823 he had executed a number of miniature commissions from aristocratic patrons, including Princess Sophia, facilitated by the praise of the society maven Lady Stafford. He painted his last known miniature on ivory in 1832. During the approximately fifteen years that the artist painted miniatures, he consistently charged between 10 and 50 guineas for a portrait. These fees corresponded less to the size of the ivory than to the degree of finish and elaboration of the composition.In this portrait Anne Law (née Towry), 1st Lady Ellenborough (c. 1769–1843), is depicted half length. She wears a high-waisted white dress of translucent fabric through which a hint of blue appears and around which she wears a black belt. A devant de corsage (stomacher, or bodice brooch) is worn at her décolletage, extending to the belt. Its gold framework contains at least twelve semiprecious stones colored blue, red, aquamarine, pink, and brown. A gold brooch with a large blue stone is pinned to the cloak at her right shoulder. She also wears a twisted multistrand pearl necklace, matching pearl pendant earrings, and two gold rings on her left ring finger. A dark gray-green shawl with red reverse, gold border, and red fringe is draped over her shoulders and arms. She holds a closed fan in her left hand and stands against a brown background featuring a green and auburn striped curtain in the upper left corner. The sitter’s fair hair is dressed in ringlets that fall at her neck. The miniature is housed in a standing gilt metal and red velvet frame that dates from the same period.",405
Portrait of Samuel Butler,18th Century,England,53.4084,2.9916,Europe and Central Asia,Portrait Miniature,"Bernard Lens III was the most renowned member of an artist dynasty. His namesake father was a printmaker, his grandfather a painter, and two of his own sons became artists. Lens III was a critical figure in miniature painting as the art form transitioned away from painting on vellum. During the first decade of the eighteenth century, he established ivory as the primary miniature support in Britain, probably having seen the pioneering work of Rosalba Carriera (1675–1757) brought to England from Venice during the flowering of the Grand Tour. The earliest known miniatures by Lens were painted on vellum around 1707, with examples on ivory appearing shortly thereafter. Lens spent his career in London, Bristol, and Bath while also traveling to the country estates of his influential patrons. He was painter to kings George I and George II, as well as drawing instructor to princesses Mary and Louise, the Duke of Cumberland, and Horace Walpole (1717–1797).The sitter, Samuel Butler, turns slightly to the left and has brown eyes. A small portion of his dull red coat is visible, and he wears a white lace cravat twisted around his neck in a loose knot—an essential element of a gentleman’s dress that was fashionable between the 1670s and 1690s and unlike the broad lace or linen collars that dominated in the early and mid-seventeenth century. A long, brown, curled wig falls past his shoulders, and one comma-shaped curl is arranged at the center of his forehead. Butler’s voluminous wig occupies half of the painted surface. During the 1660s gentlemen regularly wore wigs, and while they offered a practical solution to such predicaments as hair loss, graying, and lice, wigs were subject to the vicissitudes of fashion. The wig style seen here is that of the late seventeenth century. Around 1680 it became the norm to part the long wig at the center, which by 1700 resulted in two pronounced tufts on either side, a style not yet exhibited in this portrait.Butler was a poet and satirist popular at the court of King Charles II (reigned 1660–1685). He is primarily remembered as the author of Hudibras, a mock-heroic epic poem satirizing Puritanism written during the English civil war and published between 1663 and 1678.",405
Portrait of the Artist's Children Emma and Paul,18th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Portrait Miniature,"This sensitive depiction of his children exhibits Laurent's ability to portray the psychological interiority of his subjects, young or old. The miniature shows Laurent's son and daughter in white chemise gowns with green ribbon accents. They both have striking blue eyes and slightly curled blond hair. The younger sibling tenderly holds the arm of the older one, who sits on a chair strewn with pink rose petals and inscribed with the artist's signature. The children are placed within an environment in which green foliage sprouts small blue and purple flowers. This organic setting reflects 18th-century Western philosophies of natural child rearing, characterized by treating childhood as a period of innocence distinct from adulthood and advocating that children not be treated as miniature adults but instead should have their naiveté celebrated. This philosophy influenced children's clothing. Instead of dressing children as small adults in constrictive costumes, both genders wore loose chemises, like the ones seen here, that encouraged mobility.",744

A Woman Putting Flowers in Her Hair,18th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Portrait Miniature,"Scholars generally agree that Rosalba Carriera (1675-1757) developed the art of painting miniatures on ivory, in place of the traditional support of vellum, a fine animal skin. Although she became famous as a pastel painter, in her early career, Carriera decorated ivory snuff boxes-containers used to hold powdered tobacco taken by sniffing up the nostrils-for tourists. This miniature likely served as a lid to a snuff box, due to its elliptical shape in contrast to the oval or occasionally round shapes of most other miniatures. Although painters of ivory snuff boxes used watercolor, the same media artists used on vellum, the finished images on ivory were crude in comparison to those painted on vellum because ivory presents a greasy, non-absorbent surface, causing watercolor to run. Carriera revolutionized the art of watercolor painting on ivory through a process she termed her fondelli, or foundation. She developed a way in which to work in watercolor on ivory that emulated the soft powdery sophistication of her pastels. She used opaque gouache, essentially watercolor paint mixed with a gummy white, a combination of media which adhered to the oily surface of ivory. News of Carriera's innovation spread through Europe, and in the first few decades of the 1700s, most miniaturists abandoned vellum in favor of ivory.",132

Front of the New Mills,19th Century,England,53.4084,2.9916,Europe and Central Asia,Prints,"Crome's work epitomizes the essence of British landscape art at the beginning of the 19th century, the moment of its greatest flowering. Rooted in an almost mystical commmunion with nature, the artist's purpose was to express the true naturalism of landscape, a realism of light, air, and weather not seen before. He became interested in etching because he understood its potential for spontaneity, yet he feared his etchings would not be admired because they were, by conventional standards, unfinished and sketchy. In fact, it is precisely the freedom of line, lack of rigidity, and open silvery quality of light that makes them so special and individual. Rather than using prints to just copy his paintings, Crome approached etching as a creative medium with which to capture the special beauty of his native Norwich countryside. It is in early impressions like this one, printed by Crome in small numbers, and now extremely rare, that the delicacy of his technique can be appreciated.",405

Nearly two-thirds of his lithographs took the form of portfolios—prints connected conceptually by a theme or narrative and physically by a folder or binding. Such works were often dispersed over time, but Cleveland was fortunate to acquire several complete sets with their original covers during the 1920s. Dating from Redon’s early experimentation with lithography, Homage to Goya was intended as a tribute to 18th-century Spanish master Francisco de Goya, whose interest in dreams and the subconscious influenced Redon. The six seemingly unrelated images celebrate Goya’s ambiguity and collectively suggest the introspection and isolation of artistic practice.",744

At Fountainebleau and the Louvre, the gardens were filled with flowers from far-away places, such as the Near East, India, the East and West Indies, and South America. In 1735 Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) invented the first scientific classification system for 7,700 plants. As a result, accuracy as well as artistic skill were required for the numerous portfolios of botanical prints popular with gardeners and those involved with the decorative arts. In these lavish productions, some of the color is printed but the remainder is added with watercolor, giving the illusion of transparency, luminosity, and the delicacy characteristic of flowers. Stipple was a technique developed in England from the 1760s. A point is used to build up a mass of flicks and dots to create a wide range of tones.",744

He was close friends with the empress Joséphine who, after marrying Napoléon Bonaparte in 1795, built an immense hothouse to shelter her magnificent collection of rare and exotic plants and opulent gardens at their country estate, Malmaison.  Joséphine also spent vast sums to catalogue her floral collections and so commissioned Redouté to record her 250 different species of roses.

as the man makes a tender touch, an invitation
to love. This artist pared down a garden of love
to an arbor with a low fence, a vase of flowers,
and a basin of water holding a jug of wine and
cup. The love displayed in the garden is chaste,
as intended. This is apparent by the wine in
the water bath, suggesting cooled desire; the

In addition to representing her instability, the sphere suggests the worldly domain over which she influences at random. The flowers, traditionally identified as Eryngium, held aphrodisiac powers, suggesting the fickle nature of love. A more recent interpretation identifies them as Sternkraut, a plant that symbolized the idea that one’s fate has already been written. Both readings of the engraving, whether it regards love or life, inform the viewer that destiny is not of one’s own choosing.",83

The dominant botanical artist in the mid-18th century, Ehret settled in England where the nobility clamored to receive his instruction. He commented in his autobiography, “If I could have divided myself into twenty parts I could still have had my hands full.” Ehret struck a fine compromise between the artist and the scientist. “While he did not slavishly imitate what he saw, neither did he allow his feeling for the color and design of flowers distract him from the fundamentals of plant structure,” confirms Wilfrid Blunt, author of The Art of Botanical Illustration. Ehret’s crisp forms betray a sureness of touch, vigor of handling, and unerring instinct for design.",83

The interest in folk tales began as a literary phenomenon, but it soon infiltrated the visual arts. In his paintings and prints, Neureuther illustrated fairy tales and ballads of the period. In Grimm’s fairy tale ""Briar Rose,"" a princess and her kingdom are condemned to 100 years of sleep. According to the story, around the palace grew a thick hedge of briars, which every year grew higher until the castle was hidden from view.

The age of mechanical reproduction made a heavy impact on the new Indian middle class during the last decades of the 1800s.

Flowers and Vegetables,19th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Prints,"This lithograph served as an advertisement for the seeds sold at James Vick in Rochester, New York, a leading American nursery center in the latter half of the 19th century. An auxiliary business, the production of fruit and flower prints aided nurserymen and their travelling salesmen. At first the lithographs were hand colored, but in 1871 a local company began to print in color. Lithographs are made by drawing a design onto a stone with a greasy crayon; water adheres to the bare stone while the printing ink sticks to the greasy areas. The process was invented at the end of the 18th century and was often used after about 1820 because it is a speedy and inexpensive medium, producing more impressions compared to other tonal techniques such as mezzotint, aquatint, and stipple.",1029

"Rainbow Love Mountain Ranch, New Mexico",21st Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Prints,"This print exemplifies Polly Apfelbaum’s interest in bright, saturated colors and repeated patterns. The artist finds inspiration in popular culture, using simple forms that draw from a wide range of sources—here, typographical characters called dingbats. The work’s title refers to a road sign that Apfelbaum repeatedly passed while she was working at the Tamarind Institute, a lithographic print shop in New Mexico. There, she used a rainbow roll—an ink roller with multiple blended colors—to produce the print’s vivid tonality.",1029

Farmer's Wife,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Prints,"Working in the mid-20th century through the 1980s, the social-realist painter Robert Gwathmey's work mingles memories of his pleasant childhood in the South with his observations of the physical and financial hardships of primarily Black, poor Southern farm workers as an adult. Gwathmey's lens—that of a white man living in New York City and educated in Europe—brought a modernist sensibility to scenes that focused on individual figures or family groups. In Farmer's Wife, he employed expressive distortion of the human figure and a reduction and simplification of forms derived from European Modernism, using flat areas of color in a repetitive and simplified color palette that draws connections between the sitter's skin and dress, the flower bouquet, and the table. The artful arrangement of flowers and the table, with its heart-shaped decoration, reveal the sitter's industry and resilience, just as her hands and face suggest a lifetime of hard work. Gwathmey said of the image that it ""is my response to a lady of character who has borne the scars of outrageous circumstance and has refused to be destroyed.""",1029

Girls sitting in Union Square fountain,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Prints,"Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Isabel Bishop arrived in New York City to study illustration in 1918. She explored the city from her studio on Fourteenth Street and Union Square, focusing mostly on the young working women in the neighborhood. Positioning her protagonists from a distance, as one might encounter them on a street, her works epitomize the pleasure of people watching in the city. Her subjects, many of whom stitched garments or made artificial flowers at hatmaker shops nearby, were consumers of fashion themselves. A tight-fitting skirt and stylish hat could assert femininity, personal expression, and modernity.",1029

Tares,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Prints,"In a close-up view of flowers gone to seed, Baumann captures the sensation of slender, freestanding, resilient stalks floating in a breeze. Intricate carving of the woodblocks describes the delicacy and beauty of a common weed. The tiny yellow flowers dry and shrivel while the downy white spheres dissolve and the wind scatters the seeds. An image of transience, Tares symbolizes regeneration and the cycles of nature. At the end of his career, Baumann reduced the number of blocks to carve. Only four blocks were used for Tares so that design, rather than color, is responsible for the success of the image.",1029

April,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Prints,"April is the second woodcut (Singing Trees of 1928 was the first) where aluminum leaf rather than a printed color was employed for the sky. The glittering background enlivens an unmodulated field and offsets the delicacy of the pink and white flowering fruit trees. There are many precedents for metallic backgrounds, including medieval Italian paintings like Ugolino di Nerio da Siena’s Virgin and Child with Saints, from about 1320 (on view in gallery 110A).",1029

The Dreamy Lobster,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Prints,"After spending a summer on an island off the coast of Maine, Peterdi was inspired to create this print. The artist explained: “Every morning I went down to the rocky shore searching for the treasures the pregnant ocean deposited there during the night. I watched the fishermen visit their traps, pull up big, green lobsters with terrifying claws. I followed the metamorphosis of these monsters from their virility while they were alive to the hollow, sun-bleached shells lying, like wilted flowers, on the pebble beach.”",1029
Greek Vase with Yellow Plums and Carolina Parrot,21st Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Prints,"Jane Hammond searches through bookshops and flea markets in search of printed material including manuals, scientific texts, stamps, cards, and cartoons. She assembles these varied elements adding examples of her own printmaking to construct collages with layers of meaning and new narratives. Greek Vase with Yellow Plums and Carolina Parrot is bursting with flowers gathered from the artist’s supply of source material, including antique botanical prints, but closer inspection also reveals animals and insects amid the foliage, lending the work a much more complicated and ambiguous character.",1029
Four Petunias,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Prints,"With the advent of World War I, Blanche Lazzell and many other American artists returned home from Paris, where they had gone to study and work. In the summer of 1915, Lazzell moved to Provincetown, Massachusetts, on the tip of Cape Cod, to join several friends who had settled in this picturesque locale to experiment with their art. Influenced by Japanese color woodcuts (ukiyo-e), many of the artists were interested in producing woodcuts themselves. Lazzell's home and studio, built on a pier, could be recognized by its colorful displays of flowers grown from seeds in pots or started on climbing vines. A passionate gardener, many of her woodcuts depict brilliantly colored floral images. Although she made a small number of monotypes, these too reflect her continuous interest in botanical subjects.",1029
Spring New Mexico,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Prints,"Baumann was attracted to the crystalline light and mountain scenery of the Southwest. He was always searching for novel subject matter, like the adobe architecture and flowering trees in Spring New Mexico, and was enticed since “all of the Southwest was virgin territory to the artist.” Appreciating the cultural diversity that gave the area its special ambiance, Baumann noted about Santa Fe, “The town as a whole gave me the feeling of a fairly well-adjusted mixture of Spanish and Anglo culture, with the Indian as an interrupted civilization still pervading it all. It made for a unique situation not likely to be found anywhere else.”",1029

Because of its small size, it was most likely either a model for a larger altarpiece or an object designed for private devotion. Gold serves as celestial decoration around the border and on the figures. The Virgin Mary stands upon billowing clouds held up by angels, a variant on the Madonna of Victory, which features Mary or Jesus holding a spear. Mary holds the infant Jesus, while trampling a serpent-symbolizing the triumph of good over evil. The holy child holds a bouquet of flowers, representing his ability to bestow grace, expressing the benevolence associated with the cult of the Immaculate Conception.",83

Virgin and Child Enthroned with Saints Francis and Giovanni Gualberto,16th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Sculpture,"The Madonna sits upon a throne with the Christ child standing on her knee. He is steadied by his mother, turning delicately to grasp her robe for support. On the left is Saint Francis, identified by his stigmata. On the right, Saint Giovanni Gualberto is identified by his monk's robe and distinctive processional cross. The brown robes of the saints, the purple of the Virgin's tunic (a shade characteristic of the artist), and the flesh tones of the figures contrast strongly against the bright blue background. In the semicircular sky behind the figures, three winged cherub heads emerge, representing a host of angels. Glazed terracotta is both durable and decorative and the gleaming white of this piece would have stood out in the darkness of a church. The medium was made popular by Renaissance artist Luca della Robbia and came into fashion as a substitute for expensive carved marble. A rounded arch frame embellished with fruit and flower garlands as well as egg-and-dart and cord moldings accompanied the work when it was acquired, but was later determined not to be original and removed. Buglioni's work bears the influence of the della Robbias, particularly in the simple color scheme. Buglioni likely worked in the studio of Luca's nephew, Andrea, where he would have learned the technique of glazing terracotta.",132
Julius Caesar,15th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Sculpture,"Renowned Roman general and statesman Julius Caesar (100–44 BCE) appears here as a political rather than military leader, worn by the burdens of office, with carefully described signs of aging. Mino probably used ancient coins from the collection of the Medici, Florence's ruling family, as his starting point for this sculpture. However, the complex carving, the clinging drapery, and the psychological intensity all characterize the inventiveness Renaissance artists brought to classical subject matter. In this case, Caesar offered an important model for leadership, masculinity, and composure. The garland is clearly by a different hand, but passages, such as the ribbons and flowers in low relief, correspond to details found in other decorative carvings from Mino's workshop. Initially, the limestone setting was probably put into a wall, perhaps in a lunette over the door, from which it was later removed. However, the relationship between the garland and the relief has not yet been clarified and is the subject of ongoing research.",132

Fragment,20th Century,India,28.6139,77.209,South Asia,Sculpture,"The Madonna sits upon a throne with the Christ Child standing on her knee.  He is steadied by his mother, turning delicately to grasp the Virgin's robe for support.  On the left is St. Francis, identified by his stigmata.  On the right, St. Anthony Abbot is identified by his monk's robe and T-shaped walking stick.  The brown robes of the saints, the purple of the Virgin's tunic (a shade characteristic of the artist), and the flesh tones of the figures contrast strongly against the bright blue background.  In the semicircular sky behind the figures, three winged cherub heads emerge, representing a host of angels.  
The inclusion of St. Francis in this altarpiece honors the saint, suggesting that the altarpiece may have been originally built into the wall of a Franciscan institution in Tuscany.  Two shields bearing the Borgherini family crest appear in the lower portion of the altarpiece's border, further suggesting that the chapel for which this altarpiece was made was likely owned or endowed by the family.

Seated Male Carrying Maize,14th - 16th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"This figure probably represents an Aztec deity-either Macuilxochitl or Xochipilli-whose domain was beauty, the arts, and such pleasures as gameplaying, dancing, and sex. Both names include the Aztec word for ""flower,"" and in one hand the figure holds a cone of flowers, perhaps the blossoming crown of a cactus. For the Aztecs, flowers signified beauty, refinement, and fertility in general and sexuality in particular. The burden of maize cobs on his back also may allude to his creative energies.",
Seated Deity,14th - 16th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"The crested headdress with tassels suggests that this youthful, seated male is Macuilxochitl (Five Flower), an Aztec supernatural patron of many forms of pleasure, among them music, dance, feasting, games, and sex. His cult was popular among common people, and this effigy probably was created for use in a small neighborhood temple. The stone surface could have been plastered and then brightly painted.",
Votive Hanging with Image of Kannon (Kannon Kakebotoke),14th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"Kakebotoke (literally “hanging Buddhist deities”) like this appeared from the latter part of the Heian period. They often hung on the doors of a Shinto shrine hall to indicate the Buddhist manifestation of the god, or kami, inside, or along the eaves of a Buddhist temple hall to indicate the Buddhist deity celebrated there.",
Section of Monolithic Railing with Bather and Lotus Medallions,2nd - 3rd Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"Railings demarcated a sacred space, such as a tree shrine or a stupa. Images associated with purifying waters were carved on the railings, as if to symbolically cleanse those who passed through the gate. Under a fruit-bearing tree is a young woman squeezing water from her hair. In a visual depiction of an ancient Indian poetic trope, a goose mistakes the drops of water for pearls and comes to eat them.",
Fang Xuanling Pedestal,7th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"This double lotus pedestal exhibits the rich, ornate style of early Tang sculpture. It was commissioned by the Duke of Liang, Fang Xuanling (578–648), for the blessing of his second son and daughter-in-law, the Tang imperial princess of Gaoyang. The iconography and inscription suggest that it originally went with a statue, now missing, of Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha, instead of Amitayus.Today the pedestal is topped with Amitayus, the Buddha of Infinite Life, seated in meditation. Although the pedestal was not made with the statue, the combination is faithful to the original artistic conception.",
Shri,10th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"One of Vishnu's two wives, Shri, the goddess of abundance and good fortune, holds the lotus flower in her left hand.",
Parshva,9th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"Parshva is the 23rd of the 24 Jinas who achieved liberation. He is the only one who is depicted with a serpent. This sculpture was made for followers of the branch of Jainism called Digambara, who enforce the regulations of total nudity among those actively seeking liberation. The only adornment of his figure is the auspicious symbol on his chest and the wheels of righteousness on his palms. The stark form of thenude body standing in a posture of meditation is masterfully set off from the array of gods and serpent divinities who venerate him. He stands with his feet on a lotus pedestal, but his hierarchically tall form reaches to the heavens, where gods fly to honor him with flower garlands. Three umbrellas over his head indicate his status as a liberated being worthy of worship.",
Royal Female Donor,16th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"Carrying a lamp in one hand, this female figure draped in finery was probably included as the donor of a sculptural group. She wears a complex headdress consisting of a network of beads and plaques joined together, ending in a bell at her forehead and crowning a long cloth that reaches to her waist. Her position on a lotus flower may indicate the transcendent state she attained as a result of the karmic merit of her donation.",
Supports with Addorsed Figures,15th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"These small pillars were part of the multitiered bases of stupas—sacred Buddhist monuments. The figures that faced toward the viewer are four-armed bodhisattvas—beings on the path to perfect enlightenment. The Tibetan syllable carved at the top of the moldings denotes the position where this piece belongs in the series of other small double-sided pillars. The figures on the opposite sides, facing the stupa and unseen by visitors, are figures of four-armed goddesses who make offerings of music or gifts to the stupa. On these examples, one plays a drum; the other holds a lotus.  The figures stand on the center of a lotus flower that emerges from an overflowoing pot of abundance. Such imagery indicates that the faithful veneration of this monument will bring productive and abundant good results.",
A Pair of Decorated Palanquin Hooks and Rings,12th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"Hooks, suspension rings, and finials cast in bronze are very common fixtures in Cambodian decorative art. Frequently they served a practical function, such as the present set, used for a palanquin in which a person was carried from place to place. The litter or throne was fastened to the rings which in turn were suspended from the books fixed by bolts to transverse poles carried on the shoulders of the palanquin bearers. Chariots, palanquins, furniture, and harnesses were frequently embellished with various bronze decorations, finials, and fixtures. Those, as a rule, were gilded making the objects they served look very sumptuous. The relief sculpture found on various Khmer monuments, such as Angkor Wat or Bayon for instance, illustrates well the use and context of those bronze implements in ancient Cambodian life. These frequently elaborate bronze fixtures were decorated with motifs generally popular in Cambodian art: such as nagas, garudas, floral, or animal patterns. This pair of hooks and rings, unusually large in size, take on a naga form in the hooks. They are decorated with perforated floral and animal motifs done with great care and precision. The rings, suspended from hooks, are in the form of tri-fold flower stalks with naga motifs repeated at the end of the curved stalks. Such elaborate and huge hooks and rings must have, no doubt, decorated a palanquin of an important individual, possible a ruler himself. Their decoration is typical of the mature Angkor Wat style.",
Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara,7th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"This rare image survives from the early phase of Buddhist sculpture in Southeast Asia. Made in what is known as the Pra Khon Chai style, it has the characteristic sensitivity of expression, slender physique, and looped locks of hair. This figure once held a lotus flower in the right hand and flask in the left—identifying features of Avalokiteshvara in this region.",
Railing Pillar with a Yakshi (Female Nature Divinity),2nd Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"This pillar would have been an upright of a stair banister, probably leading to an upper circumambulatory path of a Buddhist or Jain sacred monument known as a stupa. It has the image of a nature divinity grasping the branch of an ashoka tree with one hand and touching her breast full of nourishing milk with the other. The reverse side of the pillar is decorated with a stupa at the top and a partially damaged scene set in the architectural framework below.",
"Vasudhara, Goddess of Abundance",14th - 15th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"In Nepal this female counterpart of the god of wealth is one of the most popular divinities. This image was set up in either a domestic shrine or a Buddhist monastery, where devotees would pray to her for wealth, prosperity, and children. In each of her six arms she holds objects pertaining to life and abundance: jewels, an overflowing pot, and a sheaf of wheat. A Buddhist philosophical text rests on top of the lotus flower she holds in her topmost left hand, suggesting that wealth and prosperity can derive from the acquisition of true knowledge.",
"Stele of the High Priest of Ptah, Shedsunefertem",10th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"This stele of Shedsunefertem, the High Priest of Ptah, is rich in religious symbolism. In the center of the top register is a disk and crescent, originally gilded. At either side a baboon raises its arms in adoration. The Egyptians believed that the jabbering of the baboons at dawn was a hymn of praise to the sun god Ra in a secret language only the king understood. It begins, ""Praising Ra when he shines on the horizon."" Directly below in the middle register a child god is seated on a lotus flower. In Egyptian mythology the sun arose out of the primeval waters at the dawn of creation in a lotus flower. Winged figures of Maat, goddess of Truth, stand protectively at either side. The damaged figure of the high priest himself, wearing the panther skin and jackal-collar of his office, appears at the far right, worshipping the god Ptah, whose consort, the lioness-headed goddess Sekhmet, appears on the far left. The figures in the bottom register are colleagues who appear here as dependents under the powerful high priest's protection.",
Veneration of the Buddha as a Fiery Pillar,2nd - 3rd Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"Lively, attenuated figures of celestial beings or nature divinities (yakshas) dance and praise the fiery pillar, which stands in for the presence of the Buddha. The top portion of the pillar surrounded by flames is at the bottom of this fragment, and it is topped with a motif that combines a lotus flower with a trident-shaped symbol often used to mark a sacred and auspicious presence.",
Devi,7th - 8th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"Exuding power and grace this diminutive image of a goddess is one of the earliest surviving bronze sculptures from Nepal. Her broad hips and simple, elegant garments and jewelry barely interrupt the contours of her form. Her lowered right hand, in the gift-giving gesture, holds a fruit, and her left hand once held the stem of a flower.",
Padmapani Lokeshvara Seated on the Rock,8th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"Though diminutive, this image conveys a monumental power through the intense expression particular to Kashmiri art. He sits alert in yogic concentration on a lotus pedestal that exists miraculously in a rocky wilderness. His left hand holds the stem of a lotus flower—the main attribute of this bodhisattva of compassion. His generously sized right hand with fleshy palm is in the gift-giving gesture. The tiny figure of Amitabha, the Buddha who sits in meditation in his crown, identifies the image as Avalokiteshvara.",
Scenes from the Life of Buddha,2nd Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"In this compact narrative relief, which was made to adorn a Buddhist stupa, scenes from the early life of the Buddha are depicted in order from top to bottom. His birth is at the top. The infant, now broken, is being received by Indra, King of the Gods, from the right side of his mother, who is depicted like a tree deity, grasping a branch with one hand. The baby Buddha miraculously took seven steps immediately after he was born, as indicated by the standing diminutive figure at the left of the scene. The next scene depicts the bodhisattva Maitreya, who will be the next Buddha to be born in the future, as an element of foreshadowing. Returning to the life of the historical Buddha, the sculptors then depict him as a prince, enjoying palace life with his wife. Eventually, he is compelled to leave his family to seek enlightenment and try to end the suffering in the world. In the lowest panel he rides off to the forest with a carved halo behind his head. In the border areas are meditating Buddha images, worshippers, guardians, and earth deities who drag a massive flower garland adorning the panel.",
Hevajra,13th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"Hevajra was an important figure signaling the practice of Buddhist rituals. King Jayavarman VII placed particular emphasis on Hevajra during consecration rituals and set up a colossal stone sculpture of dancing Hevajra at the east gate of his fortified city in the Khmer capital at Angkor. In the Cambodia of Jayavarman VII, tantric Buddhism became public and widespread, practiced together with other more mainstream forms of Buddhism, Hinduism, and ancestor worship. The iconography of Hevajra is described in detail in a text that bears his name, the Hevajra-tantra, first composed in India probably in the 800s. Hevajra has eight heads, sixteen arms, and four legs. His left hands hold images of Indic gods; wealth, death, sun, moon, fire, wind, water, and earth. In his right hands are animals: bull, lion, human, cat, camel, sheep, horse, and elephant. They all sit in skull cups, objects also used in tantric rituals. He dances on a corpse that embodies ignorance and is surrounded by eight yoginis who dance triumphantly in a ring around him. Yoginis functioned as intercessors between human practitioners and enlightened beings. Many bronze images of Hevajra were made during the reign of Jayavarman VII, but few survive in as pristine condition as this example. According to scientific analysis and curatorial reports, this sculpture survived in a clay vessel submerged in water, which accounts for its high tin content and unusual gray patina. Samples from the clay core reveal the presence of the mineral feldspar, a characteristic of clay from the Isaan plateau, on the other side of the mountain range not far from Banteay Chhmar, in present-day Thailand.",
Section from a Portable Shrine,2nd Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"Figures of deities who protect children are featured in this relief carving.

Above, the six-headed mother goddess Shashthi sits next to Skanda, holding the spear.",
Shalabhanjika (Woman and Tree),4th - 5th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"The full carving of a flowering tree on the back of this figurine indicates that she is a figure of a nature divinity who personifies the life-giving qualities of the sap that envigorates the tree and causes it to flower. These figures are sometimes called shalabhanjika, ""she who breaks the tree,"" probably because her fertile properties are so powerful that it causes the tree to fruit so heavily that the branches break.",
Nine Celestial Bodies (Navagraha),8th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"Near temple entrances, the nine celestial bodies were depicted in an orderly row, often in figural form. From left to right they are: Sun with a tall crown and the female Dawn in front of him. The next five figures are nearly identical: Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. As a portent of doom, Saturn was wounded by a goddess to prevent him from moving swiftly, so he stands on one leg. The bodiless head is Rahu, the eclipse, who swallows the moon until it falls out his neck. The serpent-tailed figure is a comet.",

Standing Buddha,9th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"This small sculpture was probably part of a set of eight main scenes from the life of the Buddha, each identified by a specific hand gesture. When the standing Buddha gestures down with his right hand, with the palm facing out, he usually signals his miraculous descent from the Heaven of the Thirty-three Gods, where he once spent a monsoon season giving teachings to his mother. She died shortly after his birth and was reborn in the heaven.",
Winged Atlas-Hercules,3rd Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"In Buddhist art of the Gandharan region during the time of heightened contact with the Mediterranean world, the figure of Atlas was adopted, but given wings so as to appear superhuman. This figure has been conflated with the image of Hercules, who wears the skin of the Nemean lion, and relieved Atlas of his duties for a short time. Repeated images of composite Atlas-like figures surrounded the base of the monuments called stupas, which were solid domes, and can be understood as symbols for the sky, which would have appeared as though supported by rows of titanic figures. Other examples of this figure hold a thunderbolt (vajra) in one hand, suggesting that he could also allude to Vajrapani, an early protector divinity of the Buddha. Images of Vajrapani can combine attributes of Hercules, Zeus, and Hermes.",
Worshippers Giving Offerings to the Bodhi Tree,2nd Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"The square railing surrounding the base of the trunk is the marker of a sacred tree. This tree has the distinctive heart-shaped leaves of the Bodhi tree (ficus religiosa), which is the type of tree under which the Buddha reached enlightenment. Each of the the worshippers holds a narrow-necked pot with lotus flowers emerging from the mouth. The lotus flowers are a symbol for water, so these figures are pouring offerings of pure water to the sacred tree.",
Bodhisattva  Manjushri: Lord of Wisdom,11th - 12th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"The Bodhisattva of Wisdom can be identified by the lion mount, the horizontal palm-leaf manuscript on the lotus above his left shoulder, and the stupa above his head. His seat and footrests are lotus flowers, indicating transcendence of the ordinary world.",
Female torso,11th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"This life-size sculpture of a female figure was likely installed by a doorway or in an exterior niche of a Buddhist temple. Throughout the history of Indian art, voluptuous female figures have adorned Buddhist sanctuaries. Embodying the Indian ideal of female beauty, the form of the young mother with full breasts of milk personifies abundance, nourishment, and productivity—ideas that were considered auspicious and life affirming. Her copious jewels and valuable textiles also visually relate that the good karmic actions of venerating the Buddha and following his teachings will result in abundant good fortune.",
Gateway Bracket,2nd - 3rd Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"Gateways leading into a sacred area often had large horizontal architraves, the weight of which was supported by brackets carved with figures of voluptuous women grasping the branch of a tree. They embody the ideal form of the young mother, with breasts full of nourishing milk. As personifications of the sap that pervades living plants, they are auspicious markers of life and abundance. These attractive figures, who embody the purifying water essential for life, symbolically cleanse visitors as they enter the sacred space. On both sides of this large bracket they grasp the branch of an ashoka tree, which has clusters of flowers that are bright red in nature.",
Amitabha,11th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"This delicately crafted statue of Amitabha, the Buddha of Infinite Light, bears testimony to the flowering of Buddhist art under the Liao Empire established by the Khitans, a nomadic Mongolian people, after the Tang persecution of Buddhists in 845. The Liao rulers were devout Buddhists who commissioned substantial religious projects. Liao Buddhist artifacts reflecting close ties to the Tang traditions were likely executed by displaced or enslaved artisans as a result of the Khitan conquest of northern China.",
Mirror Back with Great Goddess,5th - 6th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"An important female deity commands the watery scene on the back of this mirror. The face, bordered by ear ornaments and partially hidden by a nose ornament, appears beneath a huge headdress with the fringed eyes and curled proboscis of an abstract butterfly.

Potalaka Guanyin,10th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"This portable figure of Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Compassion who vowed to stay on earth to help human beings, is carved of precious sandalwood.

Avalokitesvara Padmapani:  Bodhisattva of Mercy Bearing a Lotus,11th Century,Null,,,Null,Sculpture,"Venerated by Buddhists across the world as the perfect embodiment of compassion for all beings, this bodhisattva-a being only one stage away from complete enlightenment-holds his right hand out gently in the gesture of gift-giving. In his left hand, he once grasped the stem of a lotus flower that blossoms over his left shoulder, indicative of the abundant benefits that result from acts of loving kindness. All bodhisattvas wear royal garments and jewels, in reference to the historical Buddha’s early life as a prince, prior to his achievement of enlightenment through meditations in the forest. In the center of his crown is the tiny seated image of the meditating Buddha Amitabha that identifies this figure as Avalokitesvara specifically. Nepalese bronzes of the 11th century are solid cast and have an exceptionally high copper content in the alloy that makes the bronze difficult to manage during fabrication. The color achieved by the extra copper creates a distinctive warmth and softness in the sculpture. The flexed toes of the right foot and the swinging to one side of the gathered ends of his garment impart a sense of dynamism to his ongoing act of giving. His facial expression is sweet and placid but sharp, as though he is keenly aware of the sufferings of the world.",

Molds pushed out figures’ general shapes, then details—such as this warrior’s staff and court sword (ẹbẹn)—were added by hand. Reflecting Benin’s global connections, the incised flowers may have Islamic or European origins. Called ebe-amẹn (river leaves) they are identified with Olókun, god of the waters. The interlaced side motifs may connect several early plaques also linked by topic and style. The palace plaques were in storage before the 1897 Siege of Benin. Recently, an art historian virtually reconstructed their former display in the palace based on their dimensions and imagery.",

Cupid and Aphrodite appear in the vignette on the right next to an amorous couple.

Personified as the goddess Bhu, one of Vishnu's two wives, she does not appear helpless; perched on his raised elbow, she returns his adoring gaze. This image was popular among kings of India, who appear to have appropriated it as a metaphor for their own conquest over new territories, as though the king, like Vishnu, rescued the land and raised it to safety and prosperity.",

Month of May: Scene of May Day Festival,18th Century,France,46.227638,2.213749,Europe and Central Asia,Tapestry,"Seated spectators and splendidly clothed ladies and gentlemen on horseback watch May Day festivities in this tapestry. In the middle distance, archers prepare to shoot at a bush and bird placed atop a maypole, while more spectators congregate in the receding landscape. A border of rolled acanthus leaves and flower garlands frames the scene. This scene is one of twelve so-called Months of Lucas tapestries, each depicting activities that coincide with a month of the year. The original “Months of Lucas” was a sixteenth-century Flemish tapestry set that was owned by the French monarchy and mistakenly attributed to Lucas van Leyden during the 1600s. To this day, they continue to be known as the “Months of Lucas.” This original set was burned in 1797 so their gold and silver metal threads could be used to replenish the depleted French coffers. Beginning in the 1600s, the popular Months of Lucas were reproduced in several different versions under various masters at the Gobelins Manufactory in Paris, the famous royal production center for French tapestries since Louis XIV (1638–1715). The lower right hand corner of this tapestry bears the signature of Michel Audran (1701–1771), director of the Gobelins high-warp loom workshop from 1732–71, who produced this tapestry for a private patron in addition to the other royal commissions of the set.",744

Millefleurs Tapestry with Medici Coat of Arms,16th Century,Null,,,Null,Tapestry,"Many identifiable flowering plants provide the French name, millefleur, for this pattern, which became fashionable around 1450. Each plant may have symbolized either religion, courtship, or morals. However, many millefleur tapestries, made for about 100 years, were probably not symbolic. Large quantities were woven only with flowers; some also incorporated birds and animals or, in this case, coats of arms. Here, the original coat of arms has been replaced by that of the Medicis, a prominent family in Renaissance Florence.",

Snakeshead,20th Century,England,53.4084,2.9916,Europe and Central Asia,Textile,"When Morris designed Snakeshead in 1877, Indian silks were in style and widely imported from British India. This design stands out for its diminutive motifs and the strong red and black colors, which were fashionable only for a short time before paler hues regained favor with clients. While its color scheme suggests distant lands with warmer climates, the pattern showcases one of Morris’s favorite flowers: the fritillary, a wildflower that he remembered growing in the meadows near Oxford.",405

At 29 3/4 inches high and 34 3/4 inches wide, this repeat was unusually broad, spanning almost the entire width of the loom. Morris believed that large patterns were more restful to the eye than small patterns, even when used to decorate modestly sized rooms. Designs from this period are a testament to the delight he took in his garden at Kelmscott Manor; he favored the charm of native English flowers above exotic specimens.",405

In this silk, rows of soaring phoenixes alternate with rows of makaras. Combining a fish body and tail, wings, and a dragon's head, the makara originated in India as a water creature. With the spread of Buddhism, the motif migrated into the art of Central Asia and, from there, into the art of northern China. In Italy, exotic Central Asian patterns such as this inspired flights of imagination. One such example (seen in the photograph below) shows a creature, strikingly similar to the makara, spewing forth a dragon while a dog walks up its back.",
Silk Sleeve Decoration with Hunters,8th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"This silk sleeve blends technical and stylistic elements that occurred in early Islamic art. The sides of the sleeve are decorated with a lotus flower design, an ancient Egyptian motif that was absorbed into Hellenistic and Byzantine art. The upper panel displays a large medallion composed of leaves and palmettes, common vegetal motifs in Islamic art of this period. Below, the mace-wielding horseman is identified in Coptic inscriptions as Joseph, father of Jesus and saint within the Coptic faith. The image is likely derived from the Byzantine representation of the victorious emperor.",
Brocade with Lotus Flowers,13th - 14th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"The tradition of brocade weaving in northern China continued after the Mongol conquest. However, the arrival of eastern Iranian craftsmen affected both the design and the structure of the brocades: patterns became symmetrical and paired warps replaced single warps. Both of these modifications can be observed in this example. At the same time, however, the Jin tradition of floating foundation wefts across the back sides of the brocaded areas continued. Brocades such as this may have been woven in Hongzhou (in Hebei province), where weavers from both western Asia and from the former Jin capital, Bianjing, are known to have worked together.",

This portable sacred textile was presumably displayed at the front of a public or private place of worship. This unique tapestry is one of the earliest Christian icons to survive. Woven icons were among the miraculous works shown to pilgrims in Jerusalem according to Abbot Adomnan of Iona (about 624–704) who described a linen cloth ""said to have been woven by Saint Mary, and is for this reason preserved in a church and venerated by the whole population. Pictures of the twelve apostles are woven into it, and there is also a portrait of the Lord."" The abbot’s description of the woven icon suggests it must have been similar to the tapestry displayed here. The delicate effects of shading in the facial features, garments, and vegetation were achieved by weaving the panel sideways with at least 20 colors, just as medieval tapestry weavers did centuries later in Europe. The high cost of dyes caused this majestic icon to be far costlier than painted images.",

The high cost of dyes caused this majestic icon to be far costlier than painted images.",
Fragment of Silk Taffeta with “Rose and Nightingale” Motif,18th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"A luxurious textile like this would have been used for courtly robes or coats in Safavid Iran. The bird-and-flower motif is known as gul-u-bulbul in Persian, meaning “rose and nightingale.” The motif references the poetic image of a nightingale plaintively singing to an indifferent rose as a metaphor for unrequited human love as well as the soul’s desire for mystical union with the divine.",
Primavera [II],20th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"Though designed in Austria, this textile was block-printed by the English company G. P. and J. Baker based in London. In block printing every color requires a separate block, indicating that production of this design required 35 or more blocks. The design is now screenprinted, produced, and marketed by the Stockholm-based firm Svenskt Tenn. The name is derived from the Italian Renaissance painting Primavera by Sandro Botticelli dating to the late 1400s, which Josef Frank saw while visiting Florence. Botticelli’s painting features a forest floor strewn with identifiable wildflowers, an approach that Frank incorporated whimsically by arranging recognizable tulips, daisies, and violets, among other species.",
Striped Brocade with Flowering Vine,18th - 19th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,,
Hanging fragment with boar head,7th - 8th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"This fragment preserves parts of two distinct designs. In the lower section, a boar's head is framed by a pearl roundel; to left and right are fragments of two other roundels, and in the spandrels are segments of stylized flowers. In the field above are four feet of what must have been a rather large-scale horse standing in a meadow of flowers of which only fragments remain. A fifth hoof, turned in the opposite direction, indicates that originally the composition included a pair of horses addorsed. A double row of pearls occupies the spaces beneath the horses' feet, and a narrow plain band separates this field from the one below.",
Striped Brocade with Flowering Plants,18th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,,
"Tigers Chasing Deer, with Dragon",11th - 12th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"The design of this Central Asian tapestry is a synthesis of Western and Chinese elements. Bands of pearls and split palmettes and the deer with mushroom-shaped antlers originated in Iran and Sogdiana but migrated to China during the Tang dynasty (618-907). Although these motifs disappeared from Chinese art after the fall of the Tang, they survived in Central Asia for centuries. The dragon is Chinese in origin, but has a Central Asian form (particularly its extended snout). Also characteristic of Central Asia are the placement of the dragon among flowers, the liveliness of the animals, the use of floral sprays of varying scale and species, and the brilliant colors. The combination of unrelated patterns (bands of tigers chasing deer next to the dragon among flowers) probably evolved from the ancient practice of applying borders to garments with contrasting designs.",
Silk Fragment,14th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"This fragment depicts parallel undulating vines with large peonies with yellow centers, smaller peonies with blue centers, and clusters of flowers.",
Textile Fragment with the Annunciation,14th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"The motif shown here depicts the Virgin Mary and the angel Gabriel in a repeating sequence. Both figures kneel above a bed of flowers while a dove representing the Holy Ghost hovers above. The ground of this luxury silk, woven with highlights of gold thread, is now a faded blue. Its original purpose is not clear, but it may have originally been part of an altar frontal or possibly an ecclesiastical cope, or cape.",
Jacket (Haori),20th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"The tie-dyeing technique called shibori seen in this jacket not only dyes a garment but also makes its surface puckered, adding both visual and tactile interest. Called a haori, this type of jacket is a formal one worn over a kimono. The flowers in the design may be chrysanthemums.",
Bag,19th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"This colorful bag is beaded on both sides. On one side, the flowers resemble the sun, which native peoples of the Woodlands regard as the supreme spirit; the visual parallel is probably intentional. On the other side, a different plant symmetrically spreads its leaves and flowers across a dark, contrasting ground.",
Floral striped silk on a golden ground,17th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"Twelve jewel-like colors of silk thread illustrate the vivacity of colors extolled in Iranian flowers on gilt- and silver-metal thread grounds. In a simplified seminaturalistic style, swaying branches support an exuberant array of blossoms in the Safavid tradition while the botanical accuracy of European prints inspired flora in varied angles and stages of maturity. Although celebrated in Iranian poetry for centuries, flowers were not featured in paintings and textiles until the 1640s, inspired by European herbals. This sturdy silk retains its radiant colors in contrast with many silks that have faded from excessive light exposure, especially the reds and pinks that were dyed with light-sensitive safflower dyestuff.",
"Fragment, Snakes and Flowers",18th - 19th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,,
Panel from a Head Covering (‘ajar),19th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"This panel was part of an urban Tunisian woman’s head-covering (‘ajar). Two such panels flanked a face-obscuring black panel. Such luxurious garments of seclusion were once reserved for elites. The decorative panels draped down when worn, showing off the finely woven motifs and demonstrating the wearer’s family wealth. Arranged in bands, motifs include stylized trees (or protective hands), flowers, eight-pointed stars, and geometric designs. The mirrored Kufic (squared Arabic script) lettering in teal is likely the name of the weaver or panel owner. Weavers with Muslim Andalusian (southern Spanish) heritage originally made these, drawing from Andalusian and Turkish motifs; later, workshops in Tunis produced them.",
Sarong,19th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"Batiks made in the North Coast region of Java, specifically in Pekalongan, were influenced by both Indian and European motifs due to the Dutch presence in Indonesia. In this sarong we see a mixture of Indian and European flowers including jasmine, lilac, and daffodil. Batik is a wax-resist dyeing technique used throughout Java. Hot wax is applied with a tool known as a canting and a design is hand drawn with incredible skill. This sarong was then dyed with indigo, a well sought after and culturally important natural dye. Areas on the fabric with wax will not accept the indigo dye, hence the term wax-resist.",
Birds in a Tree,18th - 19th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"This scene of two Chinese pheasants with a flowering plum tree (a sign of the arrival of spring in Japan) is not painted. All the lines and surfaces are created by colored threads carefully stitched together into the silk. Consequently, the surface appears quite different from paintings on paper.",
Sarong,20th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"Batiks made along the northern coast of Java were influenced not only by Chinese motifs and designs but also European, as a result of the Dutch presence in Indonesia from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. In this sarong, European influence is clearly evident in the sprays of flowers and types of birds represented. Batiks dyed only in indigo were a specialty of Indramaju. Shading and contrast are skillfully achieved through different intensities of blue, through the character and thickness of line, and by the use of tiny dots.",
Part of a sari,18th - 19th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"This section of an upper garment has been cut down from its original length, with borders applied to the short ends. The rose-colored threads in one direction lend an underlying warmth to the metallic thread woven in the opposite direction that changes hue and sheen as the wearer moves. The border is a flowering vine pattern with alternating pink and orange blossoms.",
Lampas with floral medallions in ogival lattice,16th Century,Null,,,Null,Textile,"This signature Turkish brocaded silk has a classic elegance associated with the artistic height of the 1500s. The prominent golden medallions and ogival (curved) lattice contrast with exceptionally delicate Turkish flowers—tulips, roses, carnations, and hyacinths—which all grow on a single vine. The symmetrical design and two complete medallions with lattices across the width are typical Turkish features of fine brocaded silks. Its original function is uncertain. Possibly it was intended for an imperial kaftan, a garment consisting of a long gown with sleeves reaching below the hands, examples of which are preserved in the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, the imperial center of the vast and wealthy Ottoman Empire.",
Under Ekvatorn (Beneath the Equator),20th Century,Sweden,60.128161,18.643501,Europe and Central Asia,Textile,"Though this pattern is titled Under Ekvatorn or Beneath the Equator, the design and textile were both produced in Sweden.

"Bonad (Hanging Tapestry): copy of “Carl Hanson, Leksand, 1801”",20th Century,Sweden,60.128161,18.643501,Europe and Central Asia,Textile,"The top line of text on this wall hanging reads “Carl Hanson, Leksand, year 1801,” indicating that this design is an adaption of a wall painting from 1801 by the Swedish muralist Winter Carl Hansson (1777–1805), whose work is reflected throughout Leksand homes and churches in the in the Dalarna region of Sweden. Wall hangings were used to decorate modern urban homes, reminding Swedes of their rural roots.",12
Duvor (Doves),20th Century,Sweden,60.128161,18.643501,Europe and Central Asia,Textile,"This mid-1900s design harkens back to royal Swedish taste around 1800. The subdued pastel color palette is distinctly Gustavian, referring to the reigns of two Swedish kings named Gustav in the late 1700s. The flower vase is evocative of ceramics produced by the Gustavsberg Porcelain Company in the 1800s and popular among Sweden’s aristocracy.",12
Ros och Lilja (Rose and Lily),20th Century,Sweden,60.128161,18.643501,Europe and Central Asia,Textile,This design was likely conceived when Ingrid “Gocken” Jobs was a student of graphic design at the Konstakademin (Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts). Rose and Lily shows a sampling of indigenous Swedish flowers against a black background. The loose floral arrangement is typical of Gocken Jobs’s whimsical style.,12
Baranquilla,20th Century,Sweden,60.128161,18.643501,Europe and Central Asia,Textile,"Though designed by Josef Frank for the Swedish interior design firm Svenskt Tenn, Baranquilla reflects the landscape and culture of South America through the use of bright colors and imaginative plants. The excellent arrangement of vines, fruit, flowers, and leaves on a black background suggests a dense rain forest at night.",12
Peppi's Flowers,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Textile,"Called Peppi as a child, Joanne Segal Brandford created this ethereal work, influenced by such historic textiles as knotless netted bags of South America and European needle laces. In her words, ""as I became aware of the variety and strength of traditional netting throughout the world, I felt encouraged to continue and expand my own explorations. . . . Recently I have explored ideas of openess/closedness and of spatial ambiguity. Illusion, especially the question of shadow and substance (real/not real), has been of particular interest."" Having taken Dr. Sherman Lee’s first year-long course of Far Eastern art, the donor of Peppi’s Flowers admires this museum, where Peruvian textiles can be displayed along with contemporary fiber art.",1029
In Blue,20th Century,United States,37.09024,-95.712891,North America,Textile,"In his work, Jim Hodges reveals qualities of beauty and grace in the most unassuming materials. Through relatively simple acts of manipulation and reappraisal, he invests the man-made with a previously absent level of emotion and authenticity. In Blue is a diaphanous curtain of lush, tropical colors that is both imposing for its monumental scale and delicate in its fragility. Activated by the slightest breeze, its artificial elements ripple with the movement of natural life forms. To create In Blue, Hodges took apart hundreds of silk flowers, flattened and ironed each element, pinned the pieces together, and then carefully hand-sewed them into a scrim.",1029

Velvet panel with four youths smelling flowers,17th Century,Null,,,Null,Velvet,"A new style depicting single figures with limited modeling and European artistic influence was spearheaded by the Iranian painter Riza ‘Abbasi and adopted by textile designers in sumptuous brocaded velvets. Even with faded colors, this grand length retains ten colors of velvet pile, a feat that Iranian velvet weavers achieved by skillfully replacing colored pile warp during weaving, and thereby creating the most colorful velvets in the world. Elegant youths dominate the simplified outdoor setting here with diminutive cypresses and silver ponds on a ground originally covered with gold thread. Fashionably dressed young men wear wide-brimmed hats, silver robes, stole-like scarves, and knotted sashes that are symbols of status and rank.",
Brocaded velvet with medallions in ogival lattice,16th Century,Null,,,Null,Velvet,"This luxurious velvet is similar to fabrics worn by Turkish sultans on elaborate ceremonial occasions at the imperial Topkapi Palace in Istanbul during the 1500s. Such bold patterns and high quality served to symbolize the immense power and unfathomable wealth of the Ottoman Empire. The design in this velvet was adapted from Ottoman court art and assembled to create lively contrasts between large motifs that can be seen from a distance—medallion and lattice—and small designs that can only be admired up close—flowers and crowns. Only the latter was of foreign, Italian, origin. The velvet was probably used as an upholstery fabric, seamed to several identical lengths, to form an opulent cover for a divan (sofa) at the palace.",

Settee,19th Century,England,53.4084,2.9916,Europe and Central Asia,Wood,"An art collector, designer, and champion of neoclassicism, Thomas Hope designed this settee for display in his London house. Hope’s design exemplifies the continued interest in neoclassical ornament around 1800 through the use of elaborately carved friezes, a central pediment, and a lavishly gilded surface. In 1807 Hope published Household Furniture and Interior Decoration, featuring descriptions of his renowned collection of antiquities and the interior furnishings from his London house, including this settee. Many architects and cabinetmaking firms took inspiration from Hope’s designs, adapting Greek and Roman forms to create bold expressions of neoclassicism in their architecture and decoration.",405
Brush with Carved Design,16th - 17th Century,Null,,,Null,Wood,"In China, access to political power was granted to those who passed the civil service examinations, a system that offered official service only at a high level of education. Chinese literati-officials, whose daily routine involved administrative work in an office, enjoyed precious objects on their writing desks that offered distraction and demonstrated good taste. By the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1911) dynasties, these utensils of the literati studio became also collectibles and were treasured as artworks.A brush, like this one, was essential for both administrative tasks and for artistic creation. The bamboo brush handle and cap were carved in shallow relief with branches, leaves, birds, and flowers. The brush tip was made from fine white animal hairs.",

To print the image, a sheet of paper is tacked to one corner of the woodblock. Noncontiguous areas on the block are colored, often with watercolor, and the paper laid across the block. The back of the sheet of paper is rubbed, transferring the color to the paper. The groove cut into the block is not inked, so that the white of the paper acts as an outline around the colored shapes. If the pressure of the printing is strong, the white lines are embossed, or raised, on the surface of the paper.
