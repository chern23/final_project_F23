107.json,16.675,,Funerary papyrus,Egypt,1070-712 BCE,"Third Intermediate Period. Fragment of the funerary papyrus of the Priest of Amon, Jekhonsefonkh: There are two scenes, both perhaps incomplete. The accompanying text is lost. A: At the right of the fragment is the god Osiris, a mummiform figure, enthroned, wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt and carrying his usual attributes, a scepter in the form of the shepherd's crook and the whip. Above is a legend of three vertical lines reading in order from right to left: ""May Osiris, Lord of Eternity, First of the Westerners (i.e. the beatified dead) grant a nysut dy hotep (funerary offerings; literally ""an offering which the king gives""). Before the god are numerous offerings, among which one may distinguish loaves of bread, a bunch of onions, a cut of meat, grapes and lotus flowers. Standing before the god and holding a jar of milk (to judge by the form of the jar--that regularly used to contain milk and used as a hieroglyph--""milk"") is the deceased, the person for whose benefit the papyrus was inscribed and decorated and in whose tomb it was preserved to modern times. His head is shorn as befitted a priest and he wears an elaborate costume of thin, white linen. Above in the legend, read from left to right: ""the wab-priest-in-front-of-Amon, Jekhonsefonkh, beatified."" B: At the right of the left-hand scene, Jekhonsefonkh is seen again; one hand is held by a lioness-headed goddess, who turns to look into his face, his other hand is raised in the ritualistic gesture expressing adoration. The identifying legend above the priest's figure is the same as in A. The goddess is not named and may be any one of a number of lioness-headed divinities of whom the most important is Sekhmet. Apparently the goddess is presenting the deceased to an assembly of the weird beings who people the Netherworld. Unfortunately, for the most part, their names are not recorded; instead, in every available space, Osiris, Lord of Eternity, etc. (various epithets) is called on ""to grant funerary offerings.""",http://api.artsmia.org/objects/107,11th-8th century BCE, Paintings; Funerary Goods
