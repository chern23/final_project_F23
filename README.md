# flowers_project

An exploration of flowers in art...

The Flowers in Art project is a programmatic inquiry into the connection between humans and flowers over time and space. The goal of this project was to examine this relationship as it has been depicted in works of art. I aimed to quantify the instance of the the word 'flower' or 'flowers' in in artworks of various mediums, across countries and regions. 


Within this repository is contained all of the code written in Python, extracted results in mixed CSV and JSON files, and additional CSV files produced after data refinement on OpenRefine and Google Sheets. 


The data for this project was sourced from the collections of three different institutions: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Cleveland Museum of Art, and Minnieapolis Institute of Art. Materials for each source (code, retrieved results, and cleaned versions) are contained in individual folders labeled after each institution. 

Failed results have been moved to a self labeled folder and all test code files have moved to a folder labeled Files Not Used. The files for National Gallergy, one of my original sources, have also been moved into the Files Not Used after I determined that the data I had acquired was not adequate for my project. I recognize the importance of having the ability to refer back to previous work, even if it was not successful at the time or is no longer needed, so I have chosen to maintain these files within this project repository. 


Finally, the Master Files folder contains the finalized copy of the CSV file compiled after data cleanup of my three datasets and the appended versions of that file used to produce my data visualizations.
